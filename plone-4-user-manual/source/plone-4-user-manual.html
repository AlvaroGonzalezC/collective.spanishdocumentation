                    <div><h1>What is Plone?</h1>

<p>

Plone is a content management 

system (CMS) which you can use to build a web site. With Plone, ordinary people can contribute content to a 

web site without the help of a computer geek. 

Plone runs over the Web, too, so you donât need to install any special 

software on your computer. The word <em>content</em> is meant to be general, because you can publish so many types of information, including:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/content_types_into_plone.png" alt=""></p>

<p>A Plone web site contains various kinds of content, including text, 

photos, and images. These can exist in many forms: documents, news items, 

events, videos, audio files, any types of file and data that can be 

uploaded or created on a web site. Content can also be uploaded from your local computer. You 

create <em>folders</em> on a Plone web site to hold content and to create a navigation structure:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/content_is_added_to_folders.png" alt=""></p>

<h1>You Love Butterflies<br></h1>

<p>For example, to add content about butterflies, you might add a
folder named "Butterflies," then add some text to a web page in the
folder:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/butterflies_folder_text.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And then you might add some butterfly photos to the folder:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/butterflies_folder.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can add many types of content to a folder, including
sub-folders. After adding a few reports and videos to the Butterflies
folder, the content would be organized like this, with two sub-folders
within the Butterflies folder:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/folders_within_folders.png" alt=""></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What Goes on Behind the Scenes</h1>

<p>You may wonder how it all works. 

A typical Plone web site exists as an installation of Plone software 

on a web server. The web server may be anywhere, often at a website server company within a "rack" of 

computers dedicated to the task:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/server_rack.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The diagram shows the many cables that connect individual server
computers to the Internet, across fast network connections. Your Plone
site is just software and database storage software installed on one of
the individual server computers. As you type or click on your computer,
data is sent up and down the networking cables and communication
channels of the Internet to interact with your Plone software
installation on the server.</p>

<p>Let's simplify the diagram showing how you interact with Plone:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/client_to_server_simple.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You use your web browser -- Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, etc.
-- to view and edit your Plone web site, and the changes are stored by
the Plone software into its database storage system.</p>

<p>For example, imagine your butterfly Plone web site is located at
mysite.com. You type www.mysite.com into your web browser. After you
press Enter, the following sequence of events happens as your browser
talks to the web server at mysite.com:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/client_request.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The Plone software responds:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/server_response.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Plone reads its database to look for information stored in
mysite.com. It then sends back the web page to your computer, in a code
called HTML. HTML is a computer language that describes how a web page
looks. It includes text, graphics, fonts, the color of the background,
and just about everything else. There are many online resources that
can teach you HTML details, but one of Ploneâs advantages is that you
donât need to know (much) about HTML. Thatâs one reason for Plone
and other similar web software; to let you focus on your content, e.g.,
butterfly text and graphics, instead of learning a new computer
language.</p>

<p>But back to our overview. Your web browser 

"renders" (translates) this HTML, and you see the resulting web page:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/my_site_served.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you view your butterfly web page, you can choose to change it or
add to it. You can also upload photos, documents, etc. at any time:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/plone_donut.png" alt=""></p>

<p>After you make your edits and click "save changes," the new version
of the web page will be immediately available to anyone surfing to your
site:</p>

            <h1>
                1.2.
                Visual Design of Plone Web Sites
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">Plone
allows web site administrators and designers the ability to create
unique site designs. Here's an overview of the Plone layout, and some
design examples.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>What
does a Plone web site look like?&nbsp; For years there has been a
consistent design for the default Plone appearance.&nbsp; The default
design looks generally like this:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/plone-default-design-areas.png" alt="plone-default-design-areas.png"><br><br></div>

<p>The Plone web site you use could have a design radically different
from this, but you should be able to find common elements, such as the
log in link and a navigation panel or menu.&nbsp; In the default
design, the navigation menu is in the left area, and usually appears as
an indented list of folders in the site.&nbsp; There also may be a set
of tabs in the <em>Log In, Location Information</em> strip near the top.</p>

<p class="callout">We can distinguish between the <em>design</em> of a web site and the <em>functionality</em>
of a web site.&nbsp; For getting work done, focus on the functionality
and don't worry so much about the appearance and layout of the web
site.&nbsp; A strength of the Plone content management system is that a
web site can be radically redesigned for a new look, without affecting
the underlying content and functionality. The navigation menu can be
moved from the left to the right, but it works the same.&nbsp; The
right area can be deleted where functionality normally put there isn't
needed.&nbsp; The areas for left, main, and right, as depicted above
and below, could be changed to top, middle, and bottom, but it would
still be a Plone web site underneath.</p>

<p>We'll use the default Plone layout design as an example of typical divisions of the screen:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/plonedefaultareaslabeled.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You may need to adapt these terms as needed for your Plone web site
design. You may encounter varied terms for describing screen real
estate, such as right and left "slots," for the left and right column
areas, "portlet," or "viewlet," for discrete areas or boxes, and
several other terms.</p>

<p>For example, we can select three web sites from the <a href="http://plone.net/sites">list of Plone web sites</a> to compare:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/akamaidesign.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">This is the web site for Akamai, a leading provider of
online web tools and acceleration technology. The header area has
simple text menu choices for five main content areas arrayed
horizontally at the bottom of the header area. At right, the header
contains another horizontal menu and a search box.&nbsp; The bottom of
the header area would contain log in information, for use by the
maintainers of the web site. The main graphic at top left is a focus
area for eye-catching graphics and current topics. There is a main area
at left center where the main text is located. The right column holds a
series of "portlets." The footer contains a horizontal menu, repeating
the menu choices in the header, for convenience. There is a right-most
column that has zoom settings.</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/discoverdesign.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">This is the web site for Discover Magazine. The header
area contains a large horizontal menu, the "main menu," if you will, a
smaller horizontal menu at upper right, and a search box. This site is
rich with textual "portlets" that cover so many topic areas, which are
divided into three columnar areas, left, middle, and right. The top of
the middle column contains a focus area with a video. There are large
interactive boxes in several places. The footer contains basic site
identification information and a link to "about us." For a large web
site like Discover's, maintainers of the site log in to custom editing
screens, and there is much automation of data feeds -- Plone uses Zope,
a sophisticated storage system, and Python, a great programming
language, which facilitates intelligent "wiring" of the flow of text
and graphics into the web site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/smealdesign.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">The last of the three sites to examine is the web site
for Penn State University's Smeal College of Business. The header
contains a logo, a horizontal menu for main topic areas, and a search
box at right.&nbsp; There is a main menu for this site at left, which
is more traditional for a Plone web site. A large graphical area
contains a rolling focus animation. There is another small graphical
focus in the left column.&nbsp; Three textual columns round out the
design, above the basic identification footer. Maintainers of this web
site enter by means of a custom log in page, with the log in and user
information showing along the bottom of the topmost header area.</p>

<p align="left">So, what does a Plone web site look like?
Traditionally, the out-of-the-box look is like that shown at the top of
this page, with header, menu, columns, and a footer.&nbsp; These three
sites illustrate how designers typically combine focus areas, vertical
and horizontal menus, "portlets," and textual content, usually arrayed
in several columns. The underlying machinery is Plone and Zope and
Python, but the design "theme" or "skin" can be made to look any way
the designer chooses.</p></div>

                    <div><p>Plone
web sites come in many flavors, ranging from personal websites with one
user to community, organization, or business websites that could have
hundreds of users.&nbsp; Each person who adds content to a Plone web
site has their own user account.&nbsp; A user account includes a user
name and a password.&nbsp; Some Plone sites allow people to sign up by
visiting the site, clicking a <strong>Join</strong> link, and filling
out basic user information. Other sites have user accounts that are
created by web site administrators, in which case people normally
receive emails with the user account details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However created, a Plone user account allows a person to log in by
typing their user name and password.&nbsp; Passwords are
case-sensitive, which means that you have to pay attention to the
uppercase and lowercase letters.&nbsp; For example, if your password is
xcFGt6v, you would have to type that exactly for it to work.&nbsp;
Passwords that have a variety of characters in them are preferred over
passwords like "raccoon" or "boardwalk," as they are more difficult to
guess and therefore more secure.</p>

<h2>Anonymous vs Authenticated Web Surfing<br></h2>

<p>The distinction between <em>anonymous web surfing</em> and <em>authenticated (logged-in) web activity</em> is an important one:&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Anonymous Web Surfing<br></h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the normal experience for a person
surfing the web.&nbsp; You type the web address of a web site into your
browser and you look at web pages, watch videos, view images, but you
don't have to log in.&nbsp; This is why this mode is called anonymous:
anyone can do it just by surfing normally. Note the presence of the <em>log in</em> link the screen image below (top right). If there is a <em>log in</em>
link showing, you haven't logged in -- and you are surfing the web site
anonymously, as seen in the following screen capture of a new Plone web
site:</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/plonemain3_002.png" alt=""></p>

<h3>Authenticated (Logged-in) Web Activity</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know the <em>authenticated</em> mode of
web experience if you have ever used a bank or credit card website, or
any other website that involved a user account.&nbsp; A bank web site
will let you view your account information, fill out information forms,
transfer funds, and do other actions, but only after you have logged
in.&nbsp; A Plone web site is not much different, except that you can
do more sophisticated things.&nbsp; Compare the screen image below,
captured after a user called "John Smith" has logged in.&nbsp; Near the
top right you see links for John Smith's name and a log out link. There
is another important difference you see after logging in -- the main
area in the middle now has a green header strip with tabs. This sort of
header strip is present when a user has rights to change an area of the
website.&nbsp; John Smith has the user rights to change this main
area.&nbsp; The tabs in the green header strip for the main area will
vary somewhat, but you can count on it looking like a tabbed interface
with this particular green color. In the following screen capture, user
John Smith has logged into a new Plone web site:</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/plonemain3.png" alt=""></p>

<h2>User Roles<br></h2>

<p>Equally important is the distinction between different user roles on

a Plone web site.&nbsp; To illustrate the simplest case, let's consider two

user roles, one called <em>member</em> and the other called <em>manager</em>. Consider the different rights or "power" of these two roles:</p>

<h3>Member<br></h3>

<ul><li>has a user account, so can log in</li><li>can add content, but
only in specific areas, and can't change anything outside of this area;
often users are given a "home area," to treat as personal space where
they can add content.<br></li><li>can not publish content so that it is
visible to the anonymous web surfer, even content which they added; a
person with manager role must approve content for publishing<br></li></ul><h3>Manager<br></h3>

<ul><li>has a user account, so can log in</li><li>can add content anywhere and has the power to change anything</li><li>can publish any content</li></ul><p>When
you get your new account on a Plone web site, you should&nbsp; be given
information indicating where you have the right to add content, after
you have logged in.&nbsp; After logging in, if you go to a folder where
you have rights, you'll see a header strip that has a green color with
tabs for <em>contents</em>, <em>view</em>, <em>edit</em>, rules<em></em>, and <em>sharing</em>:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/editstriptabs.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">You'll be able to explore to find the differences between these tabs, but here are descriptions to help you start:</p>

<ul><li><em>Contents</em> - shows a list of items in a folder<br></li><li><em>View</em> - shows the view an anonymous web surfer would see<br></li><li><em>Edit</em> - shows a panel for changing a view<br></li><li><em>Rules</em> - shows a panel for controlling how an item is created and managed<br></li><li><em>Sharing</em> - shows a panel for setting rights of other users to see or edit content</li></ul><p align="left">You also see menus in the lower part of the green header strip, <em>Display, Add new..., and State</em>:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/editstripmenus.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">Explore these also. Here are basic descriptions of these menus:</p>

<ul><li><em>Display</em> - shows menu choices for setting the display type (list view, summary view, etc.)</li><li><em>Add new...</em> - shows menu choices for adding content items (images, pages, folders, etc.)<br></li><li><em>State</em> - shows menu choices for setting publication state (private, public draft, public, etc.)</li></ul><p align="left">These
menus and tabs will offer the main ways you interact with Plone. You

<p>After logging in to a Plone web site you will see some indication of

click on your name to perform some actions related to your user,
covered in the following sections.</p>

<p>From Plone 4 on, you (or the site administrator) can allow users to
use their email address as login name. This feature can be switched on
in the Security settings control panel. The effect is that on the
registration form no field is shown for the user name. On the login
form the user is now asked to fill in an email address.

<p align="left">When you log in for the first time, your dashboard will
be empty, as the Info message explains. Portlets are specific "views"
of different types of content. You can choose which ones you want in
your dashboard by clicking the <em>Edit</em> tab, but we'll get to that in a second.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">First, let's look at the <em>Preferences</em> link in the previous dropdown, which will bring up the personal preferences edit panel:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/dashboardpersonalprefs.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">Date entry fields include:</p>

<ul><li><em>Full Name </em>- If your name is common, include your middle initial or middle name.<br></li><li><em>E-mail address</em>
- REQUIRED - You may receive emails from the web site system, or from a
message board, if installed, etc. When an item is required, a little
red square will show alongside the item.<br></li><li><em>Location </em>text box<em> </em>- This is the name of your city, town, state, province, or whatever you wish to provide<em>.<br></em></li><li><em>Language preference</em> selection menu - Plone excels at offering multilingual support.<br></li><li><em>Biography</em> text box - Enter a short description of yourself here, about a paragraph or so in length.<br></li><li><em>Home page</em>
web address - If you have your own web site or an area at a
photo-sharing web site, for instance, enter the web address here, if
you wish, so people can find out more about you.<br></li><li><em>Content editor</em>
selection menu - You have the choice of using TinyMCE or Kupu, which
lets you edit web pages with a nice graphical interface, or using a
basic editing panel, which is good if you are accustomed to writing web
pages using HTML (the basic "code" of web pages). The default setting
for new sites is to use TinyMCE, and is assumed in this user manual.</li><li><em>Enable external editing</em>
checkbox - This is for switching on and off an "external" editor, if
one has been installed by the web site administrator. Use of an
"external" editor is mainly for web designers and
programmers who do more editing of actual code, but it could be useful
for volume page creation using specialized text mark-up languages.
(Don't worry about this setting if you haven't heard anything about it
from your web site administrator).<br></li><li><em>Portrait</em>
photograph upload - The portrait photograph will appear as a small
image or thumbnail-size image, so it is best to use a head shot or
upper-torso shot for this.<br></li></ul><p>You can change your preferences whenever you wish.</p></div>

                Your Dashboard
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">A Plone user has a personal "dashboard" for customizing the personal user interface.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>Plone
has several built-in "views" of news, events, recently changed items,
and such. These list views are held in discrete rectangular areas
called portlets. Think of a portlet as a window view of a given type of
content. For example, the news portlet offers a view of recently
published news items.</p>

<p>You control which portlets you view in your dashboard, and where
they are placed.&nbsp; The following screen capture shows what user
Elizabeth Smith would see after logging in and clicking her own name at
upper right to go to her personal area:</p>

<p><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/dashboard.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The dashboard appears to be empty for a new user.</p>

<p>Clicking the edit tab for the dashboard will show that there are
portlets already assigned to the dashboard -- the dashboard view shown
above is empty, because there is no content available for display in
the portlets on this new web site. Here are the default portlets:</p>

<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/dashboardedit.png" alt=""><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You see the <em>News</em> and <em>Events</em> portlets in the left-most column, the <em>Recent Items</em> portlet in the second column, and the <em>Review List</em> portlet in the right column. The third column does not have a portlet assigned.</p>

<p>A new user account on a basic Plone web site will have a dashboard
like the one shown, but for a web site that has been customized with
add-on functionality, there may be more portlets to choose from, and
the dashboard might start out with several more placed in the
columns.&nbsp; For example, there could be portlets for "current
weather," "stock ticker," "quote of the day," etc., depending on what
is installed for the web site (such things would require custom
software). Depending on what is installed for the site, the user can
customize the portlets they want to see and where to place them within
the four columns.</p>

<p>So, for the typical Plone user account, the dashboard would start
with the portlets shown above, and later would be "populated" as news
items, events, and other content items are added to the web site.</p>

<p>Adding content in Plone is done <em>placefully, </em>which is to say
that you must navigate to the section of your Plone website that you
wish the new content to reside before you use the <strong>Add New . . .</strong> drop-down menu. You can of course cut, copy, and paste content items from one section to another if necessary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Content Types<br></h2>

<p>In Plone, you can use a number of<strong> Content Types</strong> to post certain kinds of content. For example, to upload an image you must use the<strong> Image</strong> content type. Below is a list of the available content types in order of their appearance, and what each are used for:</p>

<dl><dt>Collection</dt><dd>Collections are used to group and display content based on a set of <strong>criteria</strong> which you can set. Collections work much like a query does in a database.<br></dd><dt>Event </dt><dd>An
Event is a special page-like content type specifically for posting
information about an event (such as a fundraiser, barbecue, etc).&nbsp;
This content type has a function which allows the site visitor to add
the event to their desktop calendar with either the iCal or vCal
standard. This includes applications such as: Google Calendar, Outlook,
Sunbird and others.<br>
To add a single event to your calendar, click on the vCal or iCal links
next to the "Add event to calendar" text in the main view of the event
item.<br><img class="image-right" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_preview_002.jpeg" alt="Events summary table"><br>
From Plone 3.3 on you can also get all the events in a folder in one go
(currently only available in iCal format). To download the iCal file,
append <em>@@ics_view</em> to the end of the URL of the folder that contains the events. For example, if you want to get all the events into the <em>events</em> folder in the root of your site, go to <em>http://yourdomain.tld/events/@@ics_view</em>. There are plans to provide a link to this iCal calendar inside the UI in a future release.

</dd></dl><dl><dt>File </dt><dd>A File in Plone is any binary file you
wish to upload with the intent that it can be downloaded by your site
visitors. Common examples are PDFs, Word Documents, and spreadsheets.<br></dd><dt>Folder </dt><dd>Folders
work in Plone much like they do on your computer. You can use folders
to organize your content, and to give your Plone website a navigation

for uploading image files (JPG, GIF, PNG) so that you can insert them
into pages or other page-like content types.<br></dd><dt>Link </dt><dd>Also
referred to as the 'Link Object'; do not confuse this with the links
you create via TinyMCE or Kupu, Plone's visual page editors. The Link

content type is similar to Event, only News Item is specifically for
posting news. You can also attach a thumbnail image to a News Item,

menu than appear here. For information about those additional content
types, refer to the Product documentation for the add-on in question.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Title<br></h3>

<p>

Nearly all content types in Plone have two fields in common: <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Description.</strong></p>

<p align="left">The <strong>Title</strong> of content items, including folders,

images, pages, etc., can be anything you want -- you can use any keyboard

characters, including blanks. <strong>Titles</strong>

become part of web

address for each item you create in Plone. Web addresses, also known

as URLs, are what you type in a web browser to go to a specific

location in a web site (Or, you would click your way there), such as:</p>

<p align="left">www.mysite.com/about/personnel/sally/bio</p>

<p align="left">or</p>

<p align="left">www.mysite.com/images/butterflies/skippers/long-tailed-skippers</p>

<p align="left">Web addresses <em>do</em> have restrictions on allowed

keyboard characters, and blanks are not allowed. Plone does a good job

of keeping web addresses correct by using near-equivalents of the <strong>Title</strong> that you provide, by converting them to lowercase, and by substituting

dashes for spaces and other punctuation.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The web address of a given item is referred to

as the <strong>short name</strong> in Plone. When you use the <strong>Rename</strong> function, you'll see the short name along with the title.</p>

<p>The fields will vary according to the content type. For instance,
the Link content type has the URL field. The File content type has the
File field, and so on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Description<br></h3>

<p>The <strong>Description</strong> appears at the top of pages, just
under the Title. Descriptions are often used to conjunction with a
variety of Folder and Collection views (such as Standard and Summary).
The Description also appears in search results via Plone's native
search engine.</p>

                Adding Folders
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">Adding folders to a Plone web site is the basic way of controlling the organization of content.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>You
have undoubtedly created folders (directories) on your computer's hard
drive.&nbsp; Personal computers use a hierarchy of folders to structure
and organize the programs and files on the hard drive. In Plone folders
are essentially used the same way, except that they are created on a
Plone web site, for organizing content in Plone's built-in storage
system.</p>

<p>Folders are added by clicking the <strong>Add new...</strong> drop-down menu. Select <strong>Folder</strong> from the menu:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="right"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/add-item-menu-folder.jpeg" alt="add-item-menu-folder.png"></p>

<p align="left">You should now see the <em>Add Folder</em> screen:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/addfolder.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">Fill in the <strong>Title</strong>, which is required, as indicated by the red square.&nbsp; The <strong>Description</strong>
is optional; you can always come back to the edit panel if you need to
add a description of the folder. Descriptions are useful when a site
visitor uses the search tool included with Plone - results will display
with both the Title and Description of the item.</p>

<p align="left">You also notice tabs along the top: <em><br></em></p>

<ul><li><em>Default</em>, for entering the Title and Description fields, <em><br></em></li><li><em>Categorization,</em> for specifying categories that apply to the folder (you may know these as <em>keywords</em>), <em><br></em></li><li><em>Dates</em>, for setting the time period when the folder should be available for view on the web site, <em><br></em></li><li><em>Ownership</em>, for specifying the creator and/or contributors for the content item,</li><li><em>Settings,</em>

for allowing comments about the item and whether it shows in the

navigation menu for the web site.</li></ul><p align="left">These tabs are standard, so you'll

see them when you click other content types. We will cover these tabs

in another section of this user manual.</p>

<p align="left">Be sure to click <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom of the page when you are finished. This will complete the folder creation process.</p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Individual
content items on a Plone web site have discrete web addresses. Plone

                    <div><h2>What's in a Web Name?</h2>

<p align="left">The <strong>Title</strong> of content items, including folders,

images, pages, etc., can be anything you want -- you can use any keyboard

characters, including blanks. <strong>Titles</strong>
become part of web
address for each item you create in Plone.&nbsp; Web addresses, also
known as URLs, are what you type in a web browser to go to a specific
location in a web site (Or, you would click your way there), such as:</p>

<p align="left">www.mysite.com/about/personnel/sally/bio</p>

<p align="left">www.mysite.com/images/butterflies/skippers/long-tailed-skippers</p>

<p align="left">Web addresses <em>do</em> have restrictions on allowed

keyboard characters, and blanks are not allowed. Plone does a good job

of keeping web addresses correct by using near-equivalents of the <strong>Title</strong> that you provide, by converting them to lowercase, and by substituting

dashes for spaces and other punctuation.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">To illustrate, let's take each of these two

web addresses and split them out into their component parts:</p>

<pre>www.mysite.com/about/personnel/sally/bio
^ 
website name
               ^ 
               a folder named About
                     ^ 
                     a folder named Personnel
                               ^ 
                               a folder named Sally
                                     ^ 
                                     a folder named Bio
</pre>

<p align="left">In this example, Plone

changed each folder title to lowercase, e.g., from Personnel to

personnel.&nbsp; You don't have to worry about this. Plone handles the web

addressing; you just type in titles however you want.</p>

<p align="left">And, for the second example:</p>

<pre>www.mysite.com/images/butterflies/skippers/long-tailed-skippers
^
website name
               ^
               a folder named Images
                      ^
                      a folder named Butterflies
                                  ^
                                  a folder named Skippers
                                           ^
                                           a folder named Long-Tailed Skippers
</pre>

<p>This example is similar to the first, illustrating how there is a
lowercase conversion from the title of each folder to the corresponding
part of the web address. Note the case of the folder named Long-tailed
Skippers. Plone kept the dash, as that is allowed in both title and
part of the web address, but it changed the blank between the words
Tailed and Skippers to a dash, in the web address, along with the
lowercase conversion.</p>

<p>The web address of a given item is referred to

as the <strong>short name</strong> in Plone. When you use the <strong>Rename</strong> function, you'll see the short name along with the title.<br>&nbsp;</p></div>

wait a few seconds for the upload to complete (or a minute or so, if
you have a slow Web connection). A preview of the uploaded image will
be shown when the upload has finished.</p>

<p>As of Plone 4, images and files that are uploaded into Plone have
their IDs (URLs) based on the title that is given to the image (instead
of the file name of the image or file). Since the title field is not
required, if you do not fill it out, the name of the item will default
to using the name of the file in place of the title.</p></div>

<p align="left">The <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields are there at the top. Fill each of them out appropriately. There is a <em>Change note</em>
field at the bottom, also a standard input that is very useful for
storing helpful memos describing changes to a document as you make
them. This is useful for pages on which you may be collaborating with
others.</p>

<p align="left">The middle panel, <strong>Body Text</strong>, is where the action is for pages. The software used for making Pages in Plone, generically called <em>visual editor</em> and specifically a tool called TinyMCE, is a most important feature allowing you to do WYSIWYG editing. WYSIWYG editing -- <em>What You See Is What You Get</em>
-- describes how word processing software works. When you make a
change, such as setting a word to bold, you see the bold text
immediately.</p>

<p>People are naturally comfortable with the WYSIWYG approach of
typical word processors. We will describe later in this manual. Your
site-administrator may also enable so-called <a title="Footnotes" href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-4-user-manual/adding-content/adding-pages#footnotes">markup languages</a> for your site.</p></div>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/addlink.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>
Good titles for links are important, because the titles will show up in
lists of links, and because there tend to be quite a number of links
held in a folder as a set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paste the web address in the URL field or type it in. There is no
preview feature here, so it is best to paste the web address from a
browser window where you are viewing the target for the link to be sure
you have the address correct.<br><br></p>

<h3>The Link Object in Use</h3>

<p>A link object will behave in the following ways, depending on your login status, or permissions.</p>

<ul><li> <strong>If you have the ability to edit the link object</strong>,
when you click on the link object you'll be taken to the object itself
so that you can edit it (otherwise you'd be taken to the link's target
and could never get to the edit tab!)</li><li><strong>If you don't have the ability to edit the link object</strong>,
when you click on the link object you'll be taken to the target of the
link object. Likewise, if you enter the web address of the link object
directly in your browser, you'll be taken directly to the link's
target. The link object in this case acts as a <em>redirect</em>.<br></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

type it in.<br><br>One
part of the panel needs a bit more explanation: the event start and end
times.&nbsp; The year, month, day, and other fields are simple
pull-down menus.&nbsp; But for the day, often you can't remember
exactly and you need to consult a calendar. There is a handy pop-up

you'll see this pop-up calendar:<br><div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/calendarpopuppanel.jpeg" alt=""></div>

                Setting Basic Properties
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">The
tab panels available on each content item has fields for basic
information. Providing such data is important, providing fuel for the
engines that run Plone.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>Any
content item, when clicked by a user with edit rights for the item,
will show a set of tabs at the top for setting basic properties:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/basicpropertiestabs.jpeg"></p>

<p>These basic properties tabs are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Default</em> - shows the main data entry panel for the content item</li>

<li><em>Categorization</em> - shows a panel for creating and setting categories (keywords) for the item</li>

<li><em>Dates</em> - shows the publishing date and expiration date for the item</li>

<li><em>Ownership</em> - shows a panel for setting creators, contributors, and any copyright information for the item</li>

<li><em>Settings</em> - shows a small panel for setting whether or not
the item will appear in navigation menus and if comments are allowed on
the item</li>

</ul><p>The input fields under these tabs cover basic descriptive information called <em><strong>metadata</strong></em>.Â&nbsp; Metadata is sometimes called "data about data." Plone can use this metadata in a multitude of ways.</p>

<p>Here is the <em>Categorization</em> panel, shown for a page content item (would be the same for other content types):</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/editpagecategorization.jpeg"></p>

<p>Â&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Note: Tags were formerly called Categories in Plone 3, and Keywords prior to version 3.0. </em></p>

<p>The main input field for the panel is for specifying <em>categories</em>. Create them anew, just by typing in words or phrases, one per line, in the <strong>New tags</strong>
box. When you save, the new tags will be created within the system of
tags for the web site, and this content item will be filed under them.
If you re-edit this item, or edit any other, the new tags will show up
as <strong>Existing tags</strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>Related Items</em> field lets you set links between content
items, which will show as links at the bottom, when a content item is
viewed. This is useful when you don't want to use explicit categories
to connect content.</p>

<p>The <em>Location</em> field is a geographic location, suitable for use with mapping systems, but appropriate to enter, for general record keeping.</p>

<p>The <em>Language</em> choice normally would be allowed to fall to
the site default, but on multilingual web sites, different languages
could be used in a mix of content.</p>

<p>The <em>Dates</em> panel has fields for the publishing date and the
expiration date, effectively start and stop dates for the content if
you wish to set them:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/datessettings.jpeg"><br><div align="left">The <em>Ownership</em>
panel has three free-form fields for listing creators, contributors,
and information about copyright or ownership rights to the content:</div>

<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/ownershipsettings.jpeg"><br><div align="left">The <em>Settings</em>
panel has fields that may vary a bit from content type to content type,
but generally there are input fields controlling whether or not the
item appears in navigation, or if there are comments allowed, and other
similar controls:<br><div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/settingspanel.jpeg"></div>

</div>

</div>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>There is no requirement to enter the information specified through these panels, but it is a good idea to do so. For the <em>Ownership</em>
panel, providing the data is important for situations where there are
several people involved in content creation, especially if there are
multiple creators and contributors working in groups.Â&nbsp; You don't
always need fields such as publishing and expiration dates, language,
and copyrights, but these data should be specified when appropriate. A
content management system can only be as good as the data completeness
allows.</p>

<p>Specifying categories requires attention, but if you are able to get
in the habit, and are zealously committed to creating a meaningful set
of categories, there is a big return on the investment. The return
happens through the use of searching and other facilities in Plone that
work off the categorization.Â&nbsp; The same holds for setting related
items. You'll be able to put your finger on what you need, and you may
be able to discover and use relationships within the content.</p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<h3>Exposing Metadata Properties as meta tags in the HTML source</h3>

<p>From Plone 4 on, inÂ&nbsp;<em>Site Setup â Site</em>, there is a
check box that will expose the Dublin Core metadata properties.
Checking this box will expose the title, description, etc. metadata as
meta tags within the HTMLÂ&nbsp;<code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.<br>For example:</p>

<pre>&lt;meta content="short description" name="DC.description" /&gt;
&lt;meta content="short description" name="description" /&gt;
&lt;meta content="text/html" name="DC.format" /&gt;
&lt;meta content="Page" name="DC.type" /&gt;
&lt;meta content="admin" name="DC.creator" /&gt;
&lt;meta content="2009-11-27 17:04:03" name="DC.date.modified" /&gt;
&lt;meta content="2009-11-27 17:04:02" name="DC.date.created" /&gt;
&lt;meta content="en" name="DC.language" /&gt;a</pre>

<p><a class="ext-link" href="http://dublincore.org/"><span class="icon"> </span></a>The generator will check and obey theÂ&nbsp;<a class="external-link" href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/developer-manual/plone-properties/site-properties/view?searchterm=allowAnonymousViewAbout">allowAnonymousViewAbout setting</a> and affects the properties<em>Creator</em>,Â&nbsp;<em>Contributors</em> andÂ&nbsp;<em>Publisher</em>.</p>

                Restricting Types in a Folder
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">The Add new... menu has a choice for restricting the content types that can be added to the folder.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>Restricting
types available for adding to a folder is the simplest way to control
content creation on a Plone web site. You may want to restrict content
types if your site is going to be worked on by several people. In this
way you can enforce good practices such as putting just images in the
images folder.</p>

<p> First, select the last choice in the <em>Add new...</em> menu called <em>Restrictions...</em>:</p>

<div align="right"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/addnewmenu.jpeg" alt="add-new-menu.png"></div>

<p>There are three choices shown for restricting types in the folder:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/restricttypes.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">The default choice, to use the setting of the parent
folder. Having this as the default means that if you create a folder
and restrict the types that can be added, any subfolders created in the
folder will automatically carry the restrictions. The second choice, to
allow the standard types to be added, is a way to reset to the default,
unrestricted setting. The last choice allows selection from a list of
available types:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/restricttypesmanually.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">Types listed under the <em>Allowed types</em> heading
are those available on the web site. The default, as shown, is to allow
all types. Allowed types may be toggled on and off for the folder.</p>

<p align="left">Use of <em>Secondary types</em> allows a kind of more
detailed control. For example, if it is preferred to store images in
one folder, instead of scattering them in different folders on the web
site -- a scheme that some people prefer -- an "Images" folder could be
created with the allowed type set to the Image content type <em>only</em>.
Likewise an "Company Events" folder could be created to hold only the
Event content type. If left this way, content creators would be forced
(or a single web site owner) to follow this strict scheme. Perhaps some
flexibility is desired for images, though. By checking the Image
content type under the <em>Secondary types</em> heading for the "Company Events" folder, images could be added if really needed, by using the <em>More...</em> submenu, which would appear when this mechanism is in place.</p>

<p align="left">Some people prefer a heterogeneous mix of content
across the web site, with no restrictions. Others prefer a more
regimented approach, restricting types in one organizational scheme or
another. Plone has the flexibility to accommodate a range of designs.</p></div>

                Preparing Images for the Web
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">Preparing
images for the web is an essential part of using images in Plone, or in
any online context. As you will see, size matters.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>Many
people source photographs taken with a digital
camera, but they can also be scanned images, graphical illustrations
made with software, and other specialized images.&nbsp; Let's take a
look at the case of a butterfly photo taken with a digital camera.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital photographs taken with modern cameras are usually

too big to post directly on a website, so they need to be resized.&nbsp; A

typical web site design may have a width of around 1000 pixels. When a

photograph comes off your camera, it may be several thousand pixels

wide and tall, and several megabytes in file size.&nbsp; You need to use

software on your computer to resize the image to something less than

1000 x 1000 pixels, often much smaller than that.</p>

<p>The software you use to view or print your digital photos will often

have this resizing functionality, or you may have graphics software

such as Corel Draw,

Adobe Photoshop, Irfanview, or Gimp on your computer.&nbsp; Resizing an

image, sometimes called resampling, is a standard function you

should be able to find in your software, often under the <em>Image</em>

menu.</p>

<p>How do you know what width, in pixels, to resize your image?&nbsp; It

depends. For a little "head shot" photograph to go in a biography,

maybe 200 pixels wide is just right.&nbsp; For a group photograph, 200

pixels would be too small to allow identification of the people in the

photograph, so it may need to be closer to 400 pixels wide. For a scanned map

image, perhaps the image width would need to be 1000 pixels for the map

detail to be usable.</p>

<p>After saving your resized image, give it a name that indicates the new size

(e.g., butteryfly-resized-300px.jpg). The file format is most commonly

.jpg (or .jpeg). Other common formats for images include .png and

.gif.&nbsp; Take note of where you save images on your computer so that you can

find them when you upload them to your Plone web site.</p>

<p>Moving items from one area to another on a website is a common
task.&nbsp; Often this need arises with placement of content in the
wrong folder.&nbsp; For example, if the author of the following content
about Skipper butterflies realizes that a Swallowtail butterfly was
mistakenly included -- the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail folder shown below
-- the folder can simply be moved with a <em>cut</em>/<em>paste</em> operation:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/copy_of_operationcut.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Note that the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail folder has been checked, and that the <em>cut</em> button is about to be clicked.&nbsp; After clicking the <em>cut</em> button, the screen will show a new <em>paste</em>
button. The Eastern Tiger Swallowtail folder and all of its contents
are now in the web site's "memory."&nbsp; The Eastern Tiger Swallowtail
folder does not immediately disappear, however, awaiting the actual <em>paste</em> operation. The <em>paste</em> button is now highlighted to show the cut/paste operation is in progress:</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/operationpaste.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The <em>paste</em> button is now active. The next step is to navigate to the destination folder, in this case the Swallowtails folder:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/copy_of_operationpaste2.png" alt=""></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After clicking the Swallowtails folder, the <em>paste</em> button will continue to show, because the paste operation has not yet been completed:</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/operationpaste3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>&nbsp;And last, clicking the <em>paste</em> button for the
destination folder adds the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail folder to its
proper place in the Swallowtails folder, and cuts it from the original
location, the Skippers folder, and the <em>cut</em>/<em>paste</em> operation is complete:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/operationpaste4.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">The <em>paste</em> button remains active, because you
would be allowed to continue pasting the folder in other places if you
wanted.&nbsp; This could happen in several situations, including when
you need to copy one page, for example, as a kind of template or basis
document, into several folders.</p>

<h3>Copy/Paste</h3>

<p>A <em>copy</em>/<em>paste</em> operation is identical to the <em>cut</em>/<em>paste</em> operation, except that there is no removal of content from the original folder. It works as you would expect it to work.</p>

                3.2.
                Editing Content
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">Editing
Plone content works the same as adding content -- usually the data
entry and configuration panels for the content are the same for editing
as for adding.
</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>Of
course, when we edit an item of content, the item already exists. Click
the Edit tab for an item and you will see the data entry panel for the
item,
along with the existing values of the item's data.</p>

<p>For an example of something really simple, where editing looks the same as adding, we can review how to edit a folder.</p>

<p>The <em>Edit</em> panel for a folder simply shows the title and

description input areas. Often a description is not provided for a

folder, so the only thing changed is the title.&nbsp; If you do wish to

give a description, which is a good idea for distinguishing folders in

a list, the description can be text only -- there is no opportunity for

setting styling of text, such as bold, italics, or other formatting.&nbsp;

This keeps the descriptions of Plone content items as simple as

possible.</p>

<p>Here is the <em>Edit</em> panel for a folder, in this case, one called "Butterflies":</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/edititemfolder.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">That's it. Change what you want and save, and the
content item will be updated in Plone's storage system. You can
repeatedly edit content items, just as you can repeatedly edit files on
your local computer.&nbsp; By now you have appreciated that Plone
stores discrete content items as separate entities, akin to "files" on
a local computer, but you really don't have to think about it that way.
Plone is a content management system, where the content comes in the
form of numerous discrete content items that may be individually
edited. Edit away at your heart's content.</p>

<p>For an example of editing a content item that is a bit different
than adding in the first place, we can examine editing an image.
Editing an Image can be done by navigating to an individual image
and clicking the <em>Edit</em> tab. Clicking the <em>Edit</em> tab for the image, you will see the following <em>Edit Image</em> panel:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/editimage.png" alt=""></div>

<p>Here, an image called "Eastern Tiger Swallowtail Butterfly" is being edited.&nbsp; You can

change the title and description, as usual, in which case you would

usually keep the setting to "Keep existing image."&nbsp; You can also change

the image itself by checking the "Replace with new image" choice. Or,

clicking the "Delete current image" choice will simply delete the image

entirely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notice also the <em>Transform</em> tab at the top, which pertains specifically to images, offering a choice of several image transforms:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/transformimage.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So, editing an image is a bit different than adding one in the first place, but not by much.</p>

<p>Editing panels for other content items are also usually just like the panels for adding.</p>

<h3>Inline Editing (<em>optional</em>)<br></h3>

<blockquote class="pullquote">

<p>Inline editing is disabled by default in the latest versions of
Plone (3.3+). It can be enabled through the control panel by a Site
Manager (Site Setup -&gt; Site -&gt; Enable Inline Editing checkbox).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The normal procedure to edit a content item is to click the <em>Edit</em>
tab and use the discrete input fields for the item.&nbsp; For text
fields, such as Title, Description, Body Text, etc., there is a quicker
way to edit called inline editing. Inline editing is used when viewing
the content item (the <em>View</em> tab is active).</p>

<p>As the mouse passes over editable text parts of the item, a subtle
box will outline the editable text. In the following screen capture,
the mouse cursor is <em>not</em> over editable text, so you see the page title and body text as normal:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/inlineeditingoff.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But when the mouse is moved over the body text, a box highlights the body text as editable:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/inlineeditingbodytext1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Clicking within the body text after the inline editing box has appeared will bring up the visual editor:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/inlineeditingbodytext2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Change or add text and save, and the normal view is back. This is
considerably quicker -- fewer clicks and less intervening wait time --
than clicking the <em>Edit</em> tab and bringing up the entire edit panel for the page.</p>

<p>If the mouse is moved over the title, also editable, an inline editing box appears:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/inlineeditingtitle1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Clicking the title after the box appears will activate a very simple editing field with a Save/Cancel choice:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/inlineeditingtitle2.png" alt=""></div>

<p><br>Change the title and save. The speed benefit of inline editing is really sensed for editing something as simple as a title.</p>

                3.3.
                Folder View
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">Folders have the Display tab which controls the several ways of showing folder contents.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>For
most content items, if you want to change how it looks, you edit the
content directly.&nbsp; But folders are a different animal. As
containers of other items, folders can display their contents in a
variety of ways. We'll cover each of the options in this section.</p>

<p>Consider a scenario where a butterfly enthusiast, John Smith, has
logged in to his web site to work on the part devoted to Skipper
butterflies.&nbsp; He navigates to the "Skippers" folder by clicking
the top tabs of the web site, or the navigation menu, which is on the
left in his default Plone web site design. When he clicks the
"Skippers" folder, the standard view tab panel, or just "standard
view," for the folder is shown:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_large_004.png" alt="folder-view-standard.png"></div>

<p>

The <em>View</em> is always how a content item would show for anonymous web site visitors. Click the <em>View tab</em>
when you want to see what a content item looks like after you have
changed something.&nbsp; For folders, you will see a listing of
contained content items, in one of several list presentations, selected
via the <em>display</em> pull-down menu. The default view is called <em>standard view</em>:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/folderdisplaymenu.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And, here is <em>summary view</em>:</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/folderviewsummary.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And, <em>tabular view</em>:</p>

<div align="center">&nbsp;<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/folderviewtabular.png" alt=""><br><br></div>

<p>And, <em>thumbnail view</em>, which is mainly useful for photographs, but still works for normal content:</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/folderviewthumbnail.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">Making a photo album is easy. Just add the photographs
(images, or image files, the most common being .jpg files) to a folder
and set the display view for the folder to <strong>thumbnail view</strong>.&nbsp;
Thumbnail view will automatically update the display as images are
added to the folder, presenting a multi-page division into sets of
images, as needed, as the number of images grows.</p>

<p align="left"> If you are uploading photographic images from a
digital camera or scanner, you will most likely want to resize them on
your local computer before uploading them, because they are too large.</p>

<h2>Setting an Individual Content Item as the View for a Folder</h2>

<p align="left">The basic list view functionality described above for
folders fits the normal way we think of folders -- as containers of
items -- but Plone adds a nice facility to set the view of a folder to
be that of any single item contained within the folder. This takes
advantage of the way the navigation system dynamically reflects the
folder structure of a Plone web site as folders are created.</p>

<p align="left">You can set the display view for a folder to show a
single page, which can be useful for showing the most recent document
within a list of documents stored in the folder. Or, you can set it to
a collection, which on its own is already a powerful content filter.
The display view setting should be used with care, because it changes
the behavior of folders, from acting as simple containers to acting as
direct links to content. Instead, you can often accomplish what you
want by only using collections, which will be covered later in this
manual.</p>

                3.4.
                Folder Contents
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">The
Contents tab shows a list of items in a folder. It is the place for
simple item-by-item actions and for the manipulative actions of copy,
cut, paste, move, reorder, etc.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>The
Contents tab for folders is like "File Manager" or "My Computer" system
utilities in Windows and Linux desktops and the "Finder" in Mac OS X,
with similar functionality.</p>

<p>Clicking the <em>Contents </em>tab for a folder, such as the "Skippers" folder below, shows the <em>Contents </em>tab panel:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_large_003.png" alt="folder-contents.png"></div>

<p>The <em>Contents</em> tab panel is immediately recognized by
observing the check boxes beside the items in the contents list.&nbsp;
Click these check boxes to select multiple items for performing <em>copy</em>, <em>cut</em>, <em>rename</em>, <em>delete</em>, or <em>change state</em> operations.</p>

<p>Plone has a clipboard for <em>copy</em> and <em>cut</em>
operations.&nbsp; If you check one or more items, and click cut or
copy, a paste button will be added to the row of buttons along the
bottom of the panel. If you then click another folder, you'll be able
to paste the items there.&nbsp; For a cut operation, the items will
remain in the source folder -- they won't disappear -- until they are
pasted somewhere.</p>

<p><em>Renaming</em> items will show a panel for entering a new name for the <em>short name</em> (or <em>id</em>) of the item, as well as the <em>title</em>.&nbsp; The distinction between <em>short name</em> and <em>title</em> is one that becomes apparent only when you rename, because Plone automatically creates the <em>short name</em> from the <em>title</em> in most Plone web sites.&nbsp; But the renaming operation must show you the <em>short name</em> as well as the <em>title</em>, because usually would want to change both, if changing either. Consider the following example:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_large_009.png" alt="rename-item.png"></p>

<p>If you were to change the title to "Long-tailed Skippers," you would
also change the short name to "long-tailed-skippers." This keeps things
tidy -- it keeps them correct, so that the URL for the item, the web
address, is kept up-to-date with the actual content item. Note that the
short name should contain no blanks. Use dashes for any blanks in the
title, and otherwise make it a carbon copy of the title. Also, use
lowercase for the short name. See also the page "<a href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-4-user-manual/adding-content/whats-in-a-web-name">What's in a Web Name?</a>"
for a description of how Plone handles web addressing and the short
name. The following video also includes in illustration of renaming:</p>

<p class="callout" align="center"><a href="http://media.plone.org/LearnPlone/Copy,%20Paste,%20Cut,%20etc.swf"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/lights-camera-action_002.png" alt="lights-camera-action.png"></a> Watch a <span class="visualHighlight">Plone 2</span> video that includes <a href="http://media.plone.org/LearnPlone/Copy,%20Paste,%20Cut,%20etc.swf">renaming an item</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>delete</em> operation is straightforward. Click to select one or more items, and then the delete button, and the items will be deleted.</p>

<p>The <em>change state</em> operation offers a great way to change the
publication state of a selection of folders, and their subfolders if
you select this option. In the following example, the publication state
for a folder called "Long-tailed Skippers" is being modified. Checking
the "Include Folder Items" will make the state change affect all
contained content.&nbsp; Don't forget that you can do this to, say,
three folders at a time, and all of their subfolders and contained
content, so that in one fell swoop you can quickly publish, unpublish,
etc.</p>

<p><em>Shift-clicking</em> to select a range of items works. This could
be very handy for a folder with more than a dozen items or so, and
would be indispensable for folders with hundreds of items.</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/advancedstatepanel.html" alt=""></p>

<p>In addition to these individual action operations, reordering is a
natural mouse-driven manipulation, as described in the next

so. Below you see the Skipper butterfly subfolders are not in
alphabetical order:</p>

                Automatic Locking and Unlocking
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">Plone
gives you a locking message that will tell you that a document was
locked, by whom, and how long ago — so you won't accidentally stomp on
somebody else's changes.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>When
somebody clicks on the Edit tab, that item immediately becomes locked.
This feature prevents two people from editing the same document at the
same time, or accidentally saving edits over another users edits. In
this example, George Schrubb has started editing the "Widget
Installation" document. When Jane Smythe (who has permissions to edit
that document as well) goes to view it, she will see the following:<br><br></p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/locking01.png" alt="locking01.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once George has finished editing the document and clicks the Save
button, the document is automatically unlocked and available to be
edited by others (should they have the proper permissions to do so, of
course).</p>

<p>However, if it becomes clear to Jane that George isn't really
editing the document anymore (e.g. the locking message says that the
item was locked several days ago and not just a few minutes ago) then
Jane can "unlock" it and make it available for editing again.</p>

<p class="callout">In Plone 3.3 or higher:<br><br>If a user leaves the edit page without clicking Save or Cancel, the

content locking will remain effective for the next ten minutes after

which time, the locked content item becomes automatically unlocked.

This timeout feature is important for browsers that do not execute the

"on-unload" javascript action properly such as Safari.<br><br>Should you desire to disable locking, go to the Plone control panel (Site Setup -&gt; Site) and uncheck <em>Enable locking for through-the-web edits</em>.</p>

                    <div><h3><strong>Creating a new version</strong><br></h3>

<p>Plone includes a versioning feature. By default, the following

content types have versioning enabled:</p>

<ul><li>Pages</li>



<li>News Items</li>



<li>Events</li>



<li>Links</li></ul><p class="discreet">Note that all other content types do track workflow history.</p>

<p>Content items can be configured to have versioning enabled/disabled

through the Site Setup â Plone Configuration panel under "Types".</p>

<p>When editing an item, you may use the <strong>change note</strong> field at the

bottom; the change note will be stored in the item's version history.

If the change note is left blank, Plone includes a default note: "Initial Revision".</p>

<p>A new version is created every time the item is saved. Versioning
keeps track of all kinds of edits: content, metadata, settings, etc.</p>

<h3>Viewing the version history</h3>

<p>Once an item as been saved, you can use the <strong>History</strong> link found near the top of the page. Simply click it to show the History overlay:</p>

<p align="center"><a title="Version History" href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-4-user-manual/managing-content/versionhistory.png"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_large_007.png" alt="history-viewlet.png"><br></a></p>

<p>The most recent version is listed first. The History viewlet provides the following information:</p>

<ul><li>The type of edit (content or workflow)</li><li>Which user made the edit</li><li>What date and time the edit occurred<br><br></li></ul><h3>Comparing versions</h3>

<p>From the History viewlet you can compare any previous version with the

current version or any other version with the version just before it.</p>

<p>To compare any previous version with the one just before it, click the <em>Compare</em> link located between two adjacent versions in the History overlay.</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_preview_005.png" alt="compare-button.png"></p>

<p>By clicking this button, you'll see a screen like this one where you can see the differences between the two versions:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_preview_010.png" alt="compare-versions.png"></p>

<p>In this example, text in red is text which has been deleted and text
in green is text which has been added to the newer version. You can
toggle between <strong>inline</strong> or <strong>as code</strong> views of the differences between versions.</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_preview_002.png" alt="Comparing Versions (HTML Source)"></p>

<p align="left">You may also compare any previous version to the <em>current</em> version by clicking the <em>Compare to current</em> link History overlay, found to the far right of each version listed.</p>

<h3>Viewing and reverting to previous versions&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></h3>

<p align="left"><strong>You can preview any previous version</strong> of a document by clicking the <em>View</em> link to the right of any version listed.<a title="Preview" href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-4-user-manual/managing-content/versionpreview2.png"><br></a></p>

Presentation Mode by editing the page, then going to the <strong>Settings</strong>
tab. Notice the Presentation Mode checkbox available there. Once
checked, a link will appear in the view of the page for a user to view
the page in Presentation Mode.</p>

<h3>How to Create Slides</h3>

<p>All the content for a presentation lives on a single page. You do
not need to create a page for each slide. A slide is created when you
use the Heading (h1) class on the page - they effectively indicate to
Plone where you want your slides to be.</p>

<p>You can have as many slides as you want in your presentation.

Just add more Heading (h1) tags to your page and the content between

that h1 tag and the next h1 tag becomes the content of your slide.</p>

<h3>How to Format a Slide</h3>

<p>It is very important to note that the <strong>Normal Paragraph style will not render any content in the slide</strong>.
Slides are meant to display summary information, not chunks of
paragraph text. As such, you must class all content in each slide with
a style other than Normal Paragraph. Examples of those styles include:</p>

<ul><li>Heading (h1)</li><li>Subheading (h3)</li><li>Definition list<br></li><li>Bulleted list<br></li><li>Numbered list<br></li><li>Literal<br></li><li>Pull-quote</li><li>Call out<br></li><li>Highlight</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

features that can be enabled, including "Working Copy". If the Plone

site you are using doesn't show the "Check out" option under the

Actions menu, you will need to contact your site manager and request

that "Working Copy Support (Iterate)" be installed.</strong></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>You might have been in a situation

like this before: you have published a document, and you need to update

it extensively, but you want the old version to exist on the web site

until you have published the new one. You also want the new document to

replace the current one, but you'd like to keep the history of the old

one, just in case. Working copy makes all this possible.</p>

<p>Essentially, you "check out" a version of the currently published

document, which creates a "working copy" of the document. You

then edit the working copy (for as long as you like) and when

you're ready for the new version to go live, you "check in" your

working copy, and it's live. Behind the scenes, Plone will replace the

original document with the new

one in the exact same location and web address â and archive the old

version as

part of the document's version history.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Using "Check out"<br></h3>

<p>First, navigate to the page you want check out. Then from the "Actions" drop-down menu, select "Check out":</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/01.png" alt=""></p>

<p>An info message will appear indicating you're now working with a working copy:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/03.png" alt=""><br><br></p>

<p>Now you're free to edit your own local copy of a published document.

During this time,&nbsp; the original document is "locked" -- that is, no one

else can edit that published version while you have a working copy

checked out. This will prevent other changes from being made to (and

subsequently lost from) the published version while you edit your copy.</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/locked.png" alt=""></p>

<h3>Using "Check in"</h3>

<p>When you are ready to have your edited copy replace the published

one, simply choose "Check-in" from the "Actions" drop-down menu:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/04a.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You will then be prompted to enter a Check-in message. Fill it out and click on "Check in":</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/04b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Your updated document will now replace the published copy and become

the new published copy.</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/05.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You will also notice that there is no longer a copy of the document in the user's personal folder.</p>

<p class="callout">Note that it is not necessary (and in fact, it is

not recommended) to use the "State" drop-down menu on a working copy.

If you inadvertently do so, however, don't panic. Just go back to your

working copy and use "Check in" from the "Actions" menu.</p>

<h3>Canceling a "Check out"</h3>

<p>If for any reason it becomes necessary to cancel a check out and <strong>you don't want to save any of your changes</strong>, simply navigate to the working copy and select "Cancel check-out":</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/cancel1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You will prompted to confirm the "Cancel checkout" or to "Keep checkout":</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/cancel2.png" alt=""></p>

<span class="Apple-style-span">

<p>Note that if the user who has checked

out a working copy is not available to check in or cancel a check out,

users with the Manager role may navigate to the working copy and

perform either the check in or cancel check out actions. That's because

not all contributors have the&nbsp;<em>Check&nbsp;in</em>&nbsp;privilege. If that option is missing from your&nbsp;<em>Actions</em>&nbsp;menu:&nbsp;</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Use the&nbsp;<em>State</em>&nbsp;menu.</li><li>Submit for publication.</li><li>Ask a reviewer to&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;change the state.</li><li>Ask the reviewer to perform the check in on your behalf&nbsp; instead.<br></li></ol><p>The check in routine will handle the state.</p>

<p>TinyMCE is the default visual editor starting from Plone 4.0,
although Kupu is also available for users who prefer it. TinyMCE was
decided to be shipped as default because Kupu wasn't being

communities, as well as a better plugin story and some other usability
niceties as adding both internal and external links via the same button.</p>

<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/toolbar_image.jpg" alt=""><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clicking this button launches the Insert Image dialog:</p>

<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/insert_image_dialog.jpg" alt=""><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>

The three columns of the dialog display:</p>

<ul><li>In the first column - a folder navigation list. </li><li>In the second column - an object navigation list, from which you can select your image file.</li><li>In the third column - image preview, and options for alignment, size and captions. <br></li></ul><p>

In the example above, an image of a rose was selected - rose.png (rather large one, at its original size of 600*450 pixels).</p>

<p>

According to the "Image alignment" option you choose, the image will be placed in

your page (and the following HTML code will be generated):</p>

<ul><li>lefthand (&lt;img class="image-left captioned" src="rose.png" alt="rose" /&gt;);</li><li>righthand (&lt;img class="image-right captioned" src="rose.png" alt="rose" /&gt;);</li><li>inline (&lt;img class="image-inline captioned" src="rose.png" alt="rose" /&gt;).</li></ul><p>

You may also choose the size of the image you need. This is especially

convenient when you deal with large images, as there is no need to

use Photoshop or other external image editing application to crop

or change the size of an image. The "Image size" dropdown list provides a choice

between many sizes and formats:</p>

<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_size.jpg" alt=""><p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Large (&lt;img src="rose.png/image_large" alt="rose" /&gt;);</li><li>Preview&nbsp;(&lt;img src="rose.png/image_preview" alt="rose" /&gt;);</li><li>Mini&nbsp;(&lt;img src="rose.png/image_mini" alt="rose" /&gt;) - the minimum-size image is formed;</li><li>Thumb (&lt;img src="rose.png/image_thumb" alt="rose" /&gt;)

-&nbsp;a thumb(inch)-size icon is made out of your image (little bigger

than 2,5cm);&nbsp;</li><li>Tile (&lt;img src="rose.png/image_tile" alt="rose" /&gt;) - a tile is made out of your image;</li><li>Icon (&lt;img src="rose.png/image_icon" alt="rose" /&gt;) - an&nbsp;icon is made out of your image;</li><li>Listing (&lt;img&nbsp;src="rose.png/image_listing" alt="rose" /&gt;) - a listing icon is made out of your image; </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Image Captioning</h2>

<p>

It is possible to put image caption under the image in TinyMCE. Caption is taken from image description. Alt text is taken

from image title. Alt text and caption update if image is updated.</p>

<p>

To enable image captioning go to <strong>Site Setup â TinyMCE</strong>. Make

sure that you have <strong>Allow captioned images</strong> selected

in the <strong>Resource Types tab</strong>.</p>

<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_caption_settings.jpg" alt=""><p>When you add image to the site, you can put some text into its description that will be displayed as an image caption.</p>

<p><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/add_image.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Now when we create a page, and insert image into it, check the box Caption:</p>

<p><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/insert_image_caption.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Save this page, and you will see the image followed by its description as the caption all inserted into a frame:</p>

                    <div><h2>Internal Links</h2>

<p>

Select a word or phrase, click the <em>Insert/edit link</em> icon, and the <em>Insert/edit link</em> panel will appear:

<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/insert_internal_link.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You use this panel by clicking on Home or Current folder to begin

navigating the Plone web site to find a folder, page, or image to which

you wish to make a link. In the example above, a page named

"Long-tailed Skippers" has been chosen for the link.&nbsp; After this panel

is closed, a link to the "Long-tailed Skippers" page will be set for

the word or phrase selected for the link.</p>

<h2>External Links</h2>

<p>Select a word or phrase, click the <em>Insert/edit link</em> icon, select <em>External</em> under <em>Libraries</em>, and the External link panel will appear:</p>

<p><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/insert_external_link.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Type the web address of the external web site in the box after
http://. When you press return or leave the field a preview will appear
to check the address. If you paste in the web address,
make sure you don't have duplicate http:// at the beginning of the
address. Then click <em>ok</em>. The external link will be set to the word or phrase you selected.</p>

<h2>Anchors</h2>

<p align="left">Anchors are like position markers within a document,

based on headings, subheadings, or another style set within the

document. As an example, for a page called "Eastern Tiger Swallowtail,"

with subheadings entitled "Description," "Habitat," "Behavior,"

"Conservation Status," and "Literature," an easy set of links to these

subheadings (to the positions within the document at those subheadings)

can be created using anchors.</p>

<p align="left">First, create the document with the subheadings set within it, and re-type the subheadings at the top of the document:</p>

<p align="left"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/anchor_page.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">Now create the anchors for each subheading. To create
each anchor move the cursor to the beginning of the subheading and
press the <em>Insert/edit anchor</em> icon. Enter the name of the anchor in&nbsp; the <em>Anchor name</em> field. Then click <em>ok</em>.</p>

<p align="left"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/insert_anchor.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">Then select each of the re-typed subheadings at the top and click the <em>Insert/edit link</em> icon to select by subheadings:</p>

<p align="left"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/insert_anchor_select_text.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">When selecting <em>Anchors</em> under <em>Libraries</em>, a panel will appear for selecting which subheading to which the anchor link should connect:</p>

<p align="left"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/select_anchor.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">The <em>Link to anchor</em> tab will appear. The right side of the

panel shows the anchors that have been set within the document.

Here the <em>Description</em> anchor is chosen for the link (for the word Description, typed at the top of the document).</p>

<p align="left">You can be creative with this powerful feature, by

weaving such links-to-anchors within narrative text, by setting anchors

to other styles within the document, and coming up with clever mixes.

This functionality is especially important for large documents.</p></div>

<p>

Setting rows and columns is straightforward. You can add a summary of the table in the <em>Summary</em> field if you like. Table

class refers to how you want the table to be styled. You have choices

<p>In the table above, the cursor has been placed in the "Special

resizing the entire table. It also activates the other table controls
in the toolbar which, lets you edit properties of a row or a cell, lets

                Using Kupu as visual editor
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">Kupu
is a platform independent web based Javascript HTML WYSIWYG editor.
What this means is that it will let you create HTML content on your web
site.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>From
Plone 4 on, TinyMCE is the default visual editor for new sites.
However, Kupu is still available to use if you prefer so. Check the <a class="external-link" href="http://manage.plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-4-user-manual/introduction/setting-your-preferences">Setting Your Preferences</a> section to learn how to set Kupu as your default editor.</p>

<p>A typical Kupu toolbar looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_large_002.png" alt="kupu-grab"></p>

<p>The

text format is normally left with the HTML setting, but some sites

offer structured text or other markup languages for editing pages.</p>

<p>The icons are:</p>

<ul><li>bold, <br></li><li>italics, <br></li><li>left align, <br></li><li>center, <br></li><li>right align, <br></li><li>numbered list, <br></li><li>bulleted list, <br></li><li>dictionary list, <br></li><li>tab left (block), <br></li><li>tab right (block), <br></li><li>image (the "tree" icon), <br></li><li>internal link (the "chain link" icon; make a link to another page in the given site), <br></li><li>external link (the "world" icon; make a link to a web page elsewhere), <br></li><li>anchor (the "anchor" icon; make a link to a specific section of a web page), <br></li><li>table (add a table with rows and columns), <br></li><li>direct HTML editing (the "HTML" icon; if you know HTML, edit the HTML for the page directly), and a <br></li><li>pulldown menu for text styling.<br></li></ul><h3>Images</h3>

<p>Place your cursor within the text of a page, then click the "tree" icon. This panel will pop up:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_large_006.png" alt="insert-image-current-folder.png"><br><div align="left"><br>Click

"Current folder" in the left side of the panel, if it isn't already

highlighted. The current folder is the folder that contains the page

you are editing -- all pages are contained inside some folder. There

are many ways to manage storage of images, including having one central

images folder, but a common method is to store images that show on a

page in the folder that contains the page (the current folder). In this

method, pages and the images associated with them are stored together

within the folder structure. If you click the Upload button, you will

be prompted to select an image on your computer and upload it. After

selecting an image to upload, the right panel will let you give the

image a title for use on the web site, and several image placement and

sizing options. Clicking OK will upload the image and place it on the

page. <br><br>The same panel will appear if you click an image on page

to select it, then click the same "tree" icon for editing the image

options or for changing the image.<br><br>You are responsible for

sizing and editing images on your computer before you upload them, but

one easy way to handle images for use on most web pages is to make a

copy of an image on your computer, then resize it to something like

1000 pixels in largest dimension. This is a reasonable size for

uploading -- there is no need to upload your gargantuan images coming

from your digital camera. Plone will automatically create several sizes

of an uploaded image, including "large," "mini," and other sizes. You

pick the size you want to use when your upload or edit the image with

the "tree" icon. You can also override the image size choice by editing

the HTML.</div>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/insertlinkpanel.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You

use this panel by clicking on Home or Current folder to begin

navigating the Plone web site to find a folder, page, or image to which

you wish to make a link. In the example above, a page named

"Long-tailed Skippers" has been chosen for the link.&nbsp; After this panel

is closed, a link to the "Long-tailed Skippers" page will be set for

the word or phrase selected for the link.</p>

<h3>External Links</h3>

<p>Select a word or phrase, click the <em>external link</em> icon, and the External link panel will appear:</p>

<p><strong>Markup languages</strong></p>

<p align="left">If you are the sort of person who likes to enter text



using so-called mark-up formats, you may switch off the visual editor



under your personal preferences, which will replace Kupu with a



simplified text entry panel. The mark-up formats available in Plone are:</p>

<ul><li><span class="link-external"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a></span></li><li><span class="link-external"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29">Textile</a></span></li><li><span class="link-external"><a href="http://www.zope.org/Documentation/Articles/STX">Structured Text</a></span></li><li><span class="link-external"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">Restructured Text</a></span></li></ul><p align="left">Each of these works by the embedding of special



formatting codes within text. For example, with structured text



formatting, surrounding a word or phrase by double asterisks will make



that word or phrase bold, as in **This text would be bold.** These



mark-up formats are worth learning for speed of input if you do a lot



of page creation, or if you are adept at such slightly more technical



approaches to entering text. Some people prefer such formats not just



for speed itself, but for fluidity of expression.</p></div>

                    <div><p>In
the upper right corner of the edit panel for any content type --
folders, images, pages, etc., and any specialized content types --
there is a menu on the right for publication state. This <em>state</em> menu has settings for controlling publication state:</p>

<p align="right"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/statemenu1.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The header for the menu will show the current publication state for the content item, such as <em>State: Private</em>,
as shown above. Private is the initial state when you create a content
item -- an uploaded image, a page, a news item -- and in the private
state, as the name indicates, the content item will generally not be
available to visitors to the web site.&nbsp; The <em>Publish</em> menu choice will make the content item available on the web site to anonymous visitors. The <em>Submit for publication</em> menu choice is used on web sites where there are content editors who must approve items for publication, as discussed below.</p>

<p>Also, and this will be very important, certain content types, such
as news items and events, will not appear on the website as you expect,
until they are explicitly <em>published</em>.</p>

<p class="callout" align="center">Store this in your memory: <strong>Publication state is important!</strong></p>

<p>Publication state can be changed only by users whose accounts have
the necessary permissions. The menu choices in the state menu will
reflect existing permissions settings. For example, in a big newspaper
web site, a reporter could add pages for news articles, but the state
menu will not show a <em>Publish</em> menu choice, only a <em>Submit for publication</em>
menu choice. This is because a reporter must submit articles up the
line to the editorial staff for approval before publication.&nbsp; If
your account has the permissions, however, the <em>Publish</em> menu choice will appear and you can simply publish in one step.</p>

<p>For an editor, a content item that has been submitted may be <em>published</em> or <em>rejected</em>,
either outright, because it is an inappropriate submission for the
situation, or for the more typical reason that the content item needs
revision.</p>

<p>After a content item has been <em>published</em>, it may be <em>retracted</em>, to change the state back to <em>public draft</em> state, or <em>sent back</em> to private, if desired. The menu choices in the state menu will change accordingly:</p>

<p align="right"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/statemenu2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Consideration should be given to retracting ("unpublishing"), or

setting to <em>private</em>, any content that has become obsolete or undesired for

some reason.&nbsp; Setting to <em>private</em>
will take the item from public view
and from showing up in search results, but will keep it around in case
the format or the actual material (text, images, etc.) is needed later.
This is especially true for content relating to events that may recur
or to one-of-a-kind creations. The decision to delete or to set to
<em>private</em> may depend on whether or not the content exists elsewhere, on a

local computer.&nbsp; If the content is large in size, in the sense of disk

space taken, perhaps saving to a local computer is

warranted before deletion, if space on the website server computer is

an issue.</p></div>

                Advanced Control
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">The
publication control system, under the advanced menu, has sophisticated
features for setting availability by date and by context.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>The <em>state</em> menu has an <em>advanced</em>... item:</p>

<p align="right"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_preview_008.png" alt="state-menu.png"></p>

<p>which brings up the <em>advanced</em> state panel:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/stateadvanced.png" alt=""></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below an explanation section at the beginning of the panel, there is
a check box showing the content that will be affected by this change of
publication state.&nbsp; It shows that the folder "Long-tailed Skipper"
will be affected by this state change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next field, <em>Include contained items</em>, is a check box for
controlling whether the state change affects this item only (the
"Long-tailed Skipper" folder) or the items it contains and all of any
subfolders and other contained items.&nbsp; This is an important check
box.&nbsp; It lets you easily change the availability of an entire
section of a website.&nbsp; For example, the "Long-tailed Skipper"
folder could contain four subfolders, for photographs, species
occurrence descriptions, taxonomic history, and behavior descriptions,
all of which has been kept <em>private</em> during the initial work to build up this content.&nbsp; All of it could be immediately made public -- it could be <em>published</em> -- by checking this box and checking <em>Publish</em> at the bottom before saving. Likewise, the <em>Submit for publication</em> choice would be used on a web site where editors controlled ultimate publication.</p>

<p>Likewise, an entire section could be immediately made <em>private</em>.
For example, if an automobile rental agency decided to remove a car
model from its fleet, an entire section of their website devoted to
this car model, with several subfolders full of pages, images, and
files, could be set to <em>private</em>.</p>

<p>The next two date fields are for <em>effective date</em> and <em>expiration date</em>.
Their meanings are straightforward.&nbsp; If there is a window of time,
for which a content item or a set of content items is valid for
publication, it may be set with these fields.</p>

<p>A comment lets you attach an explanation to all content affected by
the state change. This is especially useful when several people are
working on a website, and a person less familiar with an area of the
web site looks at content and wonders why it isn't published. They
wonder, "This information looks good. Why isn't it published already?"
Then they read a comment that says something like, "Don't publish until
Richard checks on copyright issues regarding the items described
here."&nbsp; Using comments is a good idea for sensitive information,
even if you are the only person working on the web site, because you
might forget why you made a decision about publication state.</p>

<p>Finally, at the bottom there is a choice of several available states
for this action.&nbsp; It will vary, depending on the present state of
the item. For example, if the item is currently in a published state,
there won't be a choice for <em>publish</em>, if the item is presently in a <em>private</em> state, there won't be a choice for <em>make private</em>, etc.&nbsp; If an item is published already, there will be choices in this bottom part of the panel for <em>reject</em> and <em>retract</em>, for "unpublishing" at item, setting it back to <em>public draft</em> or then to <em>private</em> state.</p>

                6.3.
                Workflow Policies
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">Workflow
policies allow a site administrator to create a formalized system for
controlling publication and content management as a step-by-step flow
involving different users in set roles.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>Workflow
is an advanced subject. It involves creation of a more regimented
control of content creation, review, and publication. If you have a
user account on a typical small Plone site, you will probably not
encounter custom workflow policies, because there isn't a need for this
more sophisticated control. But, the potential is there for using this
functionality, as it is built in to Plone.</p>

<p><br>For an introduction to the workflow concept, consider an example
involving a web site for a newspaper business, for which these
different groups of people are at work:</p>

<dl><dt>Reporters </dt><dd>Can create stories, but can only submit them for review. </dd><dt>Editors </dt><dd>Can
review stories, but can't publish completely. They send positively
reviewed and edited stories up the line for further approval. </dd><dt>Copy Editors </dt><dd>Do final fact checking, fixes, and review, and may publish stories. </dd></dl><p>A <em>workflow policy</em>, sometimes abbreviated to <em>workflow</em>,
describes the constraints on state-changing actions for different
groups of people. Once the workflow policy has been created, it needs
to be applied to an area of the website for the rules to take affect.
In the example of the newspaper web site, a workflow policy would be
set up and then applied to the folders where reporters do the work of
adding news articles. Then, reporters would create stories and send
them up the line for review and approval:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/workflowsteps.png" alt=""></p>

<p align="left">Reporters would add news articles and would <em>submit</em> them (the <em>publish</em> menu choice is not available to them). Likewise, editors may <em>reject</em> the article for revision or they may, in turn, <em>submit</em>
the article up the line to a copy editor for final proofreading and
publication. In this newspaper business example, this policy could be
called something like "Editorial Review Policy." Configuring a workflow
policy is a matter of applying it to an area of
the website -- to define the scope of the workflow. This is a web site
administrator task. The web site administrator would use control panels
of Plone to specify where on the web site the "Editorial Review Policy"
applies, site-wide or to a subsection.</p>

<p align="left">Plone comes with several useful workflow policies --
the default one is a simple web publishing policy. Your web site
administrator might employ a more specific policy, such as a policy for
a community-based web site or a company Intranet (internal web system).
If so, you may need to learn some procedural
steps to publishing, but these are just elaborations of principles in
the default, basic workflow policy.&nbsp;</p>

                6.4.
                Collaboration through Sharing
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">The Sharing tab empowers you collaborate with other users through the use of several built-in roles.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><h3>Example 1: Letting others add content to a folder you created</h3>

<p>In this example, Jane Smythe has full access to her Plone site. She
can add, edit, delete and publish content anywhere in the site. For
now, she has created a folder called "Documentation" and added one Page
to it, "Project Overview". She hasn't published either the folder or
the document. The default workflow for this Plone site has not been
modified.<br><br>Now she wants to let her colleague, George Shrubb, add
content to the Documentation folder. He have permission to edit any of
the existing content, but she needs him to start adding content. Before
we follow along with Jane, let's take a peek at what George currently
sees when he logs in on this Plone site:</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;<img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/02b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Notice that as of right now, George can't even view the Documentation folder, because Jane created it and it is still in the <em>Private</em> state. All the default permissions are currently in place and work as expected.</p>

<p>Jane gives George the permissions he needs to add content to the Documentation folder.</p>

<p>Jane navigates to the Documentation folder and clicks on the Sharing tab:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/03_002.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One of the first things to notice is that Jane already has all the
permissions available for this Folder. These permissions were actually
granted from higher up in the site as indicated by the green/check mark
symbol.</p>

<p>Taking a closer look at the available permissions, they are:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Can add</strong> - This means that when this permission
is granted to a particular user (or group of users), that user can then
add new content items. And since that user was also the creator of that
content item, they will be able to edit it as they like.</li><li><strong>Can edit </strong>-
When this permission is granted on a folder, the user can not only edit
the Folder (its title and description) but can also edit any of the
items in the folder. Note, however, the user is not allowed to delete
any of the content. When this permission is granted on a Page, for
example, the user can only edit that Page and none of the other items
in the folder.<br></li><li><strong>Can view</strong> - When this permission is used on a folder or other item, the user can view the content but not make any changes.  <br></li><li><strong>Can review</strong> -&nbsp; When this permission is granted, the user can publish items.<br></li></ul><p class="callout">Note:
these permissions will override the default workflow permissions! For
example, if you grant a user "Can view" permission on a Page that is in
the Private state, that user will be able to see that Page.</p>

<p>In this example, Jane will grant George "Can add" permission on the
"Documentation" folder so that he can add content to the folder. First,
she searches to find him by his name:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/04.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Jane can now add specific permissions for George in the
"Documentation" folder. She is going to give him the "Can add"
permission and then click on "Save":</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/05_002.png" alt=""></p>

<p>&nbsp;And that's all there is to it! Let's see how George views the site now.</p>

<p class="callout">Note: George does NOT need to log out and log back
in. Permissions are always current because they are checked every time
a user accesses anything (e.g. clicks on a link) on a Plone site.</p>

<p>George clicks on the <em>Home</em> tab (for example) to refresh his view of the site and can now see the "Documentation" folder:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/06.png" alt=""></p>

<p>When George clicks on the "Documentation" tab, he notices that he
can view all the content in the "Documentation" folder, and he now is
able to add the available content types to the folder, as shown in the <em>Add new...</em> menu:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/07.png" alt=""></p>

<p>George wants to review what Jane has already created, so he clicks on the Project Overview link and sees:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/07b.png" alt=""><br><br></div>

<p>While George can view the document, his limited permissions do not
allow him to edit it or change its state. The only thing he can do
beyond viewing the document is to make his own copy of it.</p>

<p>George adds a Page called "Widget Installation" and creates the content for that Page. When he's done he saves it:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/08.png" alt=""></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jane views the work George has done. She clicks on the
"Documentation" tab and sees that George indeed has been busy. She
clicks on "Widget Installation" page to take a closer look:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/09.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Notice that Jane has full access to the page that George created.
She can edit it as well as cut/copy/paste it. Instead, she will wait
until George submits the page for review before actually doing anything
further with this page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Example 2: Letting others edit content you created<br></h3>

<p>Both Jane and George have been hard at work creating pages in the Documentation folder. <strong>Jane has published the Documentation folder and several pages:</strong></p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/09b.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Jane has decided that she wants to turn over all editing (but not
publishing) control of the "Documentation" folder to George. So she
returns to the "Documentation" folder and clicks on the <em>Sharing</em> tab:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/10.png" alt="sharing10.png"></p>

<p>From here she only needs to tick the "Can edit" check box and George
will be able to edit all the content in the "Documentation" folder --
including the "Documentation" folder itself. When George next visits
the folder and clicks on "Project Overview" (which is a Page that Jane
created), this is what he sees:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/11.png" alt="sharing11.png"></p>

<p>So now George can edit any item in the "Documentation" folder regardless of who created it or when.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Molly has joined George as a new team member. George
helps Molly start updating the "Widget Installation" document. He goes
to the sharing tab for "Widget Installation" and searches on Molly's
Full Name (not username) and gives her the "Can edit" permissions on
this document.</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/12.png" alt="sharing12.png"></p>

<p>Now when Molly goes to the "Documentation" folder, she can see the
two published items and the private item that she is now allowed to
edit:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/13.png" alt="sharing13.png"></p>

<p>And, in fact, when she clicks on the "Widget Installation" document, she is able to edit it:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/13b.png" alt="sharing13b.png"></p>

<p>Notice, however, when she clicks on either of the two items she
isn't allowed to edit, she doesn't have any additional access. She can
view these two items because they are published and in the default
Plone workflow (meaning that anyone can view them).</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/13c.png" alt="sharing13c.png"></p>

<p>One final note on this example: if the "Documentation" folder was
not in the published state OR Molly had not been given any other
permissions (for example, "Can view" on the Documentation folder), then
Molly would have needed the complete URL to reach the document she had
been given access to edit. Permissions are very specific in Plone!</p>

                Introduction to Collections
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">A
Collection in Plone works much like a report or query does in a
database. Use Collections to dynamically sort and display your content.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>A <strong>Collection</strong> in Plone works much like a report or

query does in a database. The idea is that you use a Collection to

search your website based on a set of <strong>Criteria</strong> such

as: content type (page, news item, image), the date it was published,

or keywords contained in the title, description, or body.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a large catalog of photos and maps on your website. You can easily display them all at once by creating a <a title="Hyperlink" href="http://learnplone.onenw.org/glossary/hyperlink" target="_self">hyperlink</a> to the <a title="Folder" href="http://learnplone.onenw.org/glossary/folder" target="_self">folder</a>

they're stored in. You could even create different links for subfolders

if you've organized things that way. However, if your images and maps

were spread out over the site in many folders this would quickly become

cumbersome. Also, there is no way with

normal folders to display different content, from different parts of

your site based on things like:</p>

<ul><li>keywords in the title</li><li>date of creation</li><li>author</li><li>type of content</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The need for showing content in a variety of dynamic ways has given rise to <strong>Collections</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Smart Folders</strong>, or <strong>Rich Topic</strong>

in older versions of Plone). Collections do not actually contain any

content items themselves in the same way that a folder does. Instead it

is the <strong>Criteria</strong> that you establish which determines what content appears on each Collection page.</p>

<p>Common applications for Collections are:</p>

<ul><li>News Archives</li><li>Event Archives</li><li>Photos Displayed by Date Range</li><li>Content Displayed by Keyword</li></ul></div>

            <div>

to think about content being stored wherever it is stored, and about
using custom collections to gather up different "views" of the content,
is an important step to using Plone most effectively.&nbsp; It is an
intelligent system.</p>

<p>To add a collection, use the <em>Add new...</em> menu, as for adding other content types:</p>

<p align="right"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_preview_009.png" alt="p4_addnewmenu"></p>

<p align="left">You will see the Add<em> Collection </em>panel:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_large.png" alt="p4_addcollection2"></div>

<p align="left">Below the title and description fields is a set of
fields for specifying the format of search results returned by the
search criterion for the new collection. The four fields in the panel
above are in pairs. The top two fields let you limit the search results
to a number of items that will be displayed.&nbsp; The bottom two
fields let you control the order of the search result items.</p>

<h3>Setting the search criterion</h3>

<p align="left">After setting the display configuration in the edit
panel shown above, click the criteria tab to show the panel for setting
search criteria:</p>

<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_large_005.png" alt="p4_collectionssearchcrit1 2">&nbsp;</div>

<p align="left">The top area of the panel, <em>Add New Search Criteria</em>, lets you set a field and a matching criterion. The bottom area, <em>Set Sort Order</em>, is a simple selection for a field to sort on:</p>

<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_large_008.png" alt="p4_collectionssearchcrit2 2">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The criteria types for matching data in content items depend on which field is selected.</p>

<p align="left">After saving the collection, the search criteria will
be applied and the results shown when the collection is clicked.&nbsp;
You can create any number of collections for such custom views. For the
butterfly example described above, in addition to a date constraint to
find recent items, the categories field could be used to match color to
have a series of collections for "Blue Butterflies," "White
Butterfles," etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Multiple criteria can be used for a collection. For
example, a collection called "Butterflies Photographed in the Last
Month," could be made by setting a criterion on Creation Date and on
Item Type as Image.&nbsp; Such date-based collections are really
effective to show up-to-date views of content that don't require any
administrative hand-work -- once such a collection has been created, it
will automatically stay up to date.</p>

<p align="left"><em>Note:</em> A collection doesn't behave like a
normal folder â you can't add content items via the add item menu, as
you can for a normal folder.</p></div>

<p>While the main power of Collections lies in Criteria, the display

settings can make a big difference in the way your Collection will

appear. All three of the settings we will cover in this section can be found by clicking the <strong>Edit tab </strong>of a Collection.</p>

<p><strong>Inherit Criteria</strong></p>

<p>By selecting the <strong>Inherit Criteria</strong> option, the

Collection will inherit the Criteria from a parent Collection. This is

only useful when using Sub Collections. If this is checked, you can

create another Collection that is more specific than the Parent while

still retaining the basic criteria of the Parent. A simple example

might be a Parent Collection for displaying all Events in a site, and a

Sub Collection that also displays Events (by inheriting Criteria) <em>but only </em>those Events with a particular keyword.</p>

<p><strong>Limit Search Results<br></strong>We can use Limit Search Results to limit the number of results that are Collection will display <em>per page</em>.

This way if we have a Collection that is displaying News Items, we can

limit the results to five or ten, instead of having it show all News

Items on a single, large list.</p>

<p><strong>Display as a Table</strong></p>

<p>Display as a Table is simply another way to display the results of a

Collection. Instead of having the Collection spit out the results in a

list form, we can have it <strong>generate a table </strong>with the results, and set exactly what information about the results we want displayed. We customize the table by selecting the <strong>Table Columns</strong> from the left and clicking the right arrow button to move it over to the right. In the example above we chose to

include the Title of the object, its Creator, and the Effective date.

You can use any number of the columns, or all of them if you so choose.</p>

<p>When considering what to select, keep in mind that not all objects

will have the information for every column available. For example, the <strong>Start Date</strong> and <strong>End Date</strong>

only apply to Events. Therefore if you added these columns and your

table included Pages as well as Events then the rows for the Pages

would not have the Start and End Dates filled in. The other thing to

consider is that the more columns you have showing the more crowded the

table will become. The best rule of thumb is to only display what you

absolutely need to display.</p>

<p>A few more notes on selecting columns: You can select more than one
at a time by holding down the control key (Ctrl) while you click. If
you want to remove a column, select it on the right and click on the
left arrow button. Also you can add and remove columns by double
clicking on their name.</p>

                Definition of Criteria
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">Definitions and examples of the different criteria fields available</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>The
power of Collections most certainly lies with the Criteria fields.
Mastering how to use the different Criteria will allow you to use
Collections in several useful ways. In this section, we will use
examples to illustrate the many ways of using Criteria.</p>

<h3><strong>Categories</strong></h3>

<p>The Category criterion allows you to search the <strong>Category field</strong>
of objects. For this to work you must specify Categories for the
content objects ahead of time (this is done through the Categorization
tab on content objects). An example where you could use this is you
want to create a Collection that would display all objects relating to
the Category <em>Organization</em>. As you can see in the image below, we are able to select the value <em>Organization </em>for
our criterion. Then, by saving this criterion and viewing our
Collection, the results would be all content objects we had designated
with the Category <em>Organization</em>.</p>

<p>Once again the values available to you are completely dependent on
what you have specified on your objects in the Categorization tab. <br></p>

<h3><strong>Creator</strong></h3>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>When using the Creator criterion, we are <strong>filtering objects based on who created them</strong>.
This might be useful if you want to do a featured author section, where
you would only want to display content on your site that has been
created by a certain author.</p>

<p>As you can see we have several options for our criterion type. They
allow us to restrict the creator to the person currently logged in,
enter the name of another user as text, or to select users from a list.</p>

<p>If you want to display results from multiple users, you would need to use the <strong>List of Values</strong>
option. Otherwise you would normally use the Text option unless the
creator you wanted to select was yourself in which case you would use
Restrict to Current User.</p>

<p><strong><br></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>

<p>The Description field is essentially a <strong>search box type </strong>criterion. However, instead of searching the title and body of a page, it will <strong>only search for the text in the Description field</strong>
of a content object.Â&nbsp; This criterion is only really useful if you
fill out the Description field consistently for all your content
objects.</p>

<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Location</strong></h3>

<p>Using the Location criterionis much like specifying a location when
you search for a document on your hard drive. By specifying a Location
criterion, <strong>the results that are displayed in your Collection will only come from that location</strong>,
most commonly a Folder. This can be useful if you only want to display
content that is in the About Us section of your site, for example. This
is also useful for narrowing Collection results when combined with
other criteria.</p>

<p>To specify a Location, simply click the <strong>Add button</strong>,
which will pop up a new window showing you a directory of your site. If
we follow our example and want to search the About Us section of our
site, we would click the InsertÂ&nbsp; button next to the About Us
folder.</p>

<p>You can open folders to view content contained within them either by
clicking the Browse button or directly on the title of the folder you
want to open. You may also use the Search box to search for the Title
of an object. <strong><br><br></strong></p>

<h3><strong>Search Text</strong></h3>

<p>The Search Text is a very useful criterion. It is similar to the
search box on your site or an Internet search engine. It takes the text
you specify and searches the Title, Description, and Body of all
objects and returns <strong>any that have the word or phrase you specify</strong>.
This is useful when you want to find objects that have to deal with a
certain thing, especially if the word or phrase appears across many
content types. Using LearnPlone.Org as an example, if I want to create
a Collection that displays all objects that reference the word
Collections, I would use the Search Text criterion and specify <em>collections</em>. All Tutorials, Videos, Glossary items, etc with <em>collections</em> in the Title, Description, or Body would then appear in the Collection results. <br></p>

<h3><strong>Related To</strong></h3>

<p>The Related To field is another field, like Category, that <strong>must be specified on a content object prior to being used for a Collection</strong>.
The Related To field on an object lets you specify which other objects
in your site are similar or are relevant to the object you created. By
specifying this field, when you create an object you can create a web
of related content that will reference each other (think of a "see
also" kind of function). When you have done this, you can use the
Related To criterion in a Collection to display anything related to a
specific object.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>In this case we have specified that there are pages related to Our
Staff, History, and the About Us Homepage. By selecting one or multiple
values from this list, our Collection will display the pages that
related to that Value.</p>

<p>If we selected History as the value we wanted, our Collection would show us everything that is related to the History page.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Related To Values list does not work based on
which objects are related to content but on which objects have another
object related <strong>to it</strong>. The Collection will display the results that are related to that value.<strong><br><br></strong></p>

<h3><strong>State</strong></h3>

<p>Using the State criterion is very simple. It allows us to <strong>sort by published or private</strong> state. It is a very good idea to restrict publicly viewable Collections <strong>to filter on published</strong>,
so that no private content appears in the Collection results. Filtering
on the Private state can be useful as well. For example, a site
administrator might want to quickly see private content, so that they
could determine what work needs to be done and what could deleted.<br></p>

<h3><strong>Dates</strong></h3>

<p>You may have noticed that there are <strong>several different dates available</strong> to use as Criteria. Since there are such a large number of dates, they will be covered on their own section of the manual.</p></div>

            <h1>
                7.5.
                Setting the Sort Order

                    <div><p>The Sort Order <strong>determines the order the results of the Collection will be displayed

in</strong>.&nbsp;

Sort Order allows you to sort by three main categories: text, object

properties, and dates.&nbsp; When you

sort by text, objects will be sorted in alphabetical order. When

sorting by one of the object properties, we

effectively are grouping objects together by the specified properties.&nbsp;

When we sort by a date the results will be

displayed with the most recent first (although there are many 'dates'

in Plone). All Sort Orders are in Ascending Order unless the Reverse

Order check box is selected. By checking this we can display in reverse

order, or newest dates first, etc.</p>

<h3><strong>Date</strong><strong>s</strong></h3>

There are numerous Date options which will be explained in the next section of the manual.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>

Object Properties</h3>

<p><strong>Item Type</strong></p>

<p>When sorting by Item Type, we end up with a Collection that has

results that are grouped by Item Type. We would want to use this if we

have a Collection that will return many different Item Types. This way

we can make the Collection very easy to browse for the site visitor.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>State</strong></p>

<p>Sorting by State will display results grouped by the publishing

state. Since there are only two States in the default configuration of

Plone, there will only be Published and Private items. We can use this

to separate all pages on our site and easily see what we have that is

public (Published) and what we are hiding from the public eye (Private).<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Category</strong></p>

<p>Category Sort Order is useful when we want to display the objects on

our site in a manner where they are grouped by the Category we placed

them in. Keep in mind, for sorting by Category to even be remotely

useful, you must have specified the Category on several objects. If you

have not specified any Categories, then sorting by Categories will do

nothing.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Related To</strong></p>

<p>The Related To Sort Order will actually apply a criterion to your

Collection. It limits to the results to only those that have Related To

information Specified on their properties.<br><br></p>

<h3>Text</h3>

<p><strong>Short Name</strong></p>

<p>Sorting by the Short Name is the same as putting the result objects

in alphabetical order. By default Plone sets the Short Name of an

object to be the same as the Title. The difference between the two is

that the Short Name is all lower case and hyphenated between all words.

For example the Short Name for the page titled About Us would be <em>about-us</em>.

The Short Name is what Plone also uses in the URL for the page

(www.myplonesite.org/about-us). You can specify a different Short Name

for an object by using the Rename button on the Contents tab.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Creator</strong></p>

<p>Sorting by the Creator will group all results in alphabetical order

by their author. For example, let's say we had several documents

published by Bob Baker and several of other documents published by Jane

Smith. Sorting by the creator would result in all the documents created

by Bob Baker listed first followed by those of Jane Smith.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Title<br><br></strong>Sorting by Title will display the results in alphabetical order, by the object Titles.<br><br></p>

            <p class="documentDescription">Explanation of the Dates associated with Collections and their uses</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>There are several different types of dates we can choose from, many of them sounding similar.

Because of this it is very easy to get confused about which date to use. Below, each date option is defined.<br></p>

<h2>Dates Defined<br></h2>

<p><strong>Creation Date</strong><br>The Creation Date is the date the

document was made. You can think of this as its birthday, the day it

was born. You cannot change the Creation Date of an object.<br><strong><br>Effective Date</strong><br>The Effective Date is the date when an

object becomes published. This date is customizable through the <strong>Edit tab</strong> on objects

under the <strong>Date tab</strong>. However, there it is referred to as the Publishing Date (a minor discrepancy in Plone's nomenclature).</p>

<p><strong>Creation Date</strong> and <strong>Effective Date</strong>

are very similar. They both are representative of the beginning point

of an object. A very important point to keep in mind when choosing

which one you want to use, is that an object can be created long before

it ever becomes public. You could have a page that is worked on for

several weeks before it is actually published. Thus you would get

different results in a Collection depending on which date you used. <br><br>We recommend using the <strong>Effective Date</strong>,

instead of Creation Date for date-oriented Collections. This way your

Collection shows results based on when they became viewable to the

public, which is more relevant to the audience of your Collection.

Also, you can go in and manually adjust the Effective Date to control

the sort order which is not something you can do with the Creation Date.<br><strong><br>Expiration Date</strong><br>The Expiration Date refers

to the day that the item will no longer become publicly

available. This date is also customizable through the Edit tab (shown

above) like the Effective Date. By default, objects have no Expiration

Date.<br><strong><br>Modification Date</strong><br>The Modification Date is

the date the object was last edited. Note that this date is first set

the day the object is created and will automatically change every time

the object is edited. There is no way to customize this date. You could

use this as a Sort Order along with an Item Type criterion set to Page,

to display all recently modified pages within the last week, for

example. The What's New listing on the homepage of LearnPlone.Org uses

Modification Date as its date criterion. That way both newly created

documents <em>and</em> ones that have been updated appear in the listing. <br><br></p>

<p><strong>Event Specific Dates<br></strong>The two following dates <strong>only </strong>apply to objects that are<strong> Events. </strong>These

two dates are very effective for creating Recent Events and Upcoming

Events Collections that will let your audience know what your

organization is doing and will be doing in the future.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Start Date</strong><br>The Start Date is simply the date that an Event starts.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>End Date</strong><br>The End Date is simply the date that the Event ends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Setting Dates<br></h2>

<p>A confusing thing about dates can be how its Criteria are set up.

They have a setup that is not like any of the other Criteria. First

off, you have to choose whether you want a Relative Date or a Date Range.</p>

<p>The Relative Date allows you to construct a <strong>conditional statement</strong>. Such as: Items modified less than 5 days in the past. A Date Range will allow you to <strong>specify an exact range of dates</strong>,

such as 01/02/08 to 02/02/08. The Date Range is useful when you want to

create a Collection with a static date that won't change. The Relative

Date can be very useful as it will allow you to create Collections that

are automatically updating themselves, such as a Recent News

Collections or an Upcoming Event Section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Relative Date<br></h3>

<p>Looking first at the Relative Date option, you can see we have three options to fill out.</p>

<p>The first option is <strong>Which Day</strong>. This allows us to select the number of days our criterion will include. One of the options is called <em>Now</em>. Using this will set the date range to the current day. The other two options do not matter and can be ignored when using <em>Now</em>.</p>

<p>The second option is <strong>In the Past or Future</strong>. This enables us to choose whether we are looking forward or backward into time.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>The last option is <strong>More or Less</strong>. Here we can choose from three options. <em>Less than</em> allows us to include everything from now to a period of time equal to or less than the <strong>Which Day </strong>setting, either in the past or future. <em>More than</em> will include everything from beyond our specified number of days equal to or more than <strong>Which Day</strong>. Finally <em>On the Day </em>will only include things that are on the day we specified in the <strong>Which Day</strong>. Using the example in the image above if we had selected <em>On the Day</em> instead of <em>Less than</em> our Collection would display only objects that were modified (we are using the Modification Date criterion) 5 days ago.</p>

<p>If this is confusing to you, try reading it as a statement

substituting in the field options you chose. "I want the results to

include objects <strong>More or Less</strong> than <strong>Which Day</strong>, <strong>In the Past or Future</strong>". Our example in the image above would become "I want the results to include objects <strong>Less than</strong> <strong>5 days in the past</strong>".</p>

<h3><br>Date Range</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>Date Range</strong> is much easier to understand. Both a

Start Date and End Date are required (do not confuse these terms with

the Event Specific dates!). The Date Range allows us to enter a

beginning and an end date and the display everything within that time

frame. Notice also that it allows us to specify a specific time of day

as well.</p></div>

            <p class="documentDescription">Portlets use a basic hierarchy approach which determines how and why they appear on each section of your site.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>Portlets use a basic hierarchical approach. By default, the portlets that

you assign at the root (homepage) of the site will propogate down to

all the subsections of the site. If you want a different set of

portlets or order of portlets for a particular sub-section, you must

use the <strong>Block/unblock portlets</strong> controls, to "block"

the parent portlets. When you block Portlets, you must explicitly add

all the Portlets that you wish to see on the child page.</p>

<p>The portlet management screen has been updated in Plone 4 to show all portlets,

including portlets that are blocked. Users can now see what's being

blocked and what's being inherited. When a portlet is blocked, you will

notice a subtle change in color on on the portlet management screen:</p>

<p><img class="image-inline" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_preview_006.png" alt="Blocked portlets in management"></p>

<p>In this diagram, our Portlets are designated in blue underneath the Page title:</p>

<p><img class="image-left" src="plone-4-user-manual_archivos/image_preview_004.png" alt="hierarchy.gif"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> As you can see we have two Portlets designated on our Home page

(navigation and recent items). These same Portlets appear on our About

Page because of portlet hierarchy.</p>

<p>However, on the Documentation page we added a third portlet - the

Collection Portlet. Here we are still allowing Parental Portlets, but

in addition we specifically added the Collection Portlet.</p>

<p>On <strong>both</strong> the Tutorials and Videos Pages we have to

block Parental Portlets because we do not want the Collection Portlet

that is on the Documentation Page to show. When we block Parental

Portlets we must re-add the Portlets to <strong>each</strong> Child page. In this case we re-added the Navigation Portlet to both and then added the Search Portlet to both.</p>

<p>Remember that the child pages only inherit from the parent page directly above them. In our example, if we added a page called <em>Staff</em>

under About and allowed the parent portlets without adding any

additional portlets, it would show the same Portlets as the Home Page

as well as the About Page. However do not think that it is inheriting

from the Home page. If we were to change the About Page and added a

Search Portlet, our Staff Page would reflect the Portlets on the About

Page not the Home Page.</p>

<h3>Adding a Portlet<br></h3>

<p>Adding a Portlet is as simple as selecting the <strong>Add Portlet</strong>

drop down box and clicking on the type of Portlet you would like to

add. We will cover the different options available in the next section.</p>

<h3><br></h3>

<h3>Editing an Existing Portlet<br></h3>

<p>To edit the properties of an existing Portlet, simply click on the

name of the Portlet. In the example to the left, if we wanted to edit

the properties of the Navigation Portlet, we would Click on <em>Navigation</em>. Each type of Portlet will have different configuration options available to it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Rearranging Portlets</h3>

<p>To Rearrange your Portlets, simply click the <strong>blue up or down arrow</strong>. This will affect the order your Portlets are displayed on the page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Removing Portlets</h3>

<p>To remove a Portlet, click the<strong> red "X" </strong>associated with its name.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> Hiding Portlets</h3>

<p>From Plone 4 on you can show/hide portlets using the associated show/hide links present.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you may have noticed on the Manage Portlet screen, you have the

ability to work with Portlets on both the right and left side of the

page. This is because there are two columns for Portlets to be in, a

left column and a right column. <strong>Portlets will only appear on the side that you add them on</strong>.</p>

<p>With Portlets, you can add more than one of the same type on a page.

There is no limit to how many times you can use an individual Portlet

or a limit to how many total Portlets can be on a Page.</p></div>

be configured through Manage Portlets and others require some setup

through the ZMI or by creating other content objects first. Below is a

basic description of the use and functionality of each available

Portlet type.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>The Navigation Portlet <strong>allows users to navigate your site </strong>with

ease by providing a structured "site map", or navigation tree. You have

the option to display the navigation for the overall site or choose to

only display the current folder contents. On LearnPlone.Org, you can

see an example of the Navigation Portlet in the left column. As you dig

deeper into the site, the tree will continue to expand. There are

several configuration options available that effect how the Navigation

Portlet will behave.<br><br></p>

<h3>Calendar</h3>

<p>The Calendar Portlet is a very simple Portlet that will display a

Calendar on your site. This Portlet has no customizable options. If you

have published Event content objects on your site, the days upon which

they occur will be bolded in the calendar and will link to the

corresponding events on your site.</p>

<h3><br></h3>

<h3>Classic<br></h3>

<p>A Classic Portlet is refers to the way portlets were used in older

version of Plone, prior to Plone 3. You must create a Page Template in

the ZMI and properly set the path and macro to enable the portlet. This

requires technical knowledege of both TALES and the ZMI.<br><br></p>

<h3>Collection</h3>

<p>The Collection Portlet will allow you to <strong>display the results of a Collection</strong>.

You must have a Collection previously created when you add this

Portlet, then you can specifying the Collection to be used . This is a

great way to summarize the results of an important Collection so that

it is easily viewable to the public. For instructions on creating a

Collection Portlet follow this <a title="Collection Portlets" class="internal-link" href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-4-user-manual/portlet-management/resolveuid/eb8800b7a664b35d069ddbcae7e4c837">How-to</a>.<br><br></p>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>The Events Portlet will <strong>display Upcoming Events</strong>,

provided that you have Events on your site. You can determine how many

events you want to be displayed and also which events you want to

display based on publishing state. <br><br></p>

<h3>Log in</h3>

<p>The Log in Portlet is another non configurable Portlet that will simply <strong>display a Log in Form</strong>

that will allow users with Log in information to log in to the site.

Once a user is logged into the site, this Portlet will not appear.<br><br></p>

<h3>News</h3>

<p>The News Portlet works exactly like the Events Portlet. However instead of displaying Events, it <strong>displays recent News items</strong>. Once again you can choose how many News items are displayed and filter them based on their state.<br><br></p>

<h3>RSS Feeds</h3>

<p>The RSS Feed Portlet allows you to link to an RSS Feed, choose how many items to display, and specify the refresh rate.<br><br></p>

<h3>Recent Items</h3>

<p>The Recent Items Portlet displays a customizable <strong>number of Recent Items</strong>, listed by Title. A Recent Item is determined by its Last Modified Date.<br><br></p>

<h3>Review List</h3>

<p>The Review List Portlet will display a <strong>list of objects that have been submitted for review</strong>.

If you are using a submit and review cycle (and have properly set

global roles for your users) this is a great way for reviewers to see

what content has been submitted for review. This Portlet only appears

to those logged in as this state is not viewable to the public.<br><br></p>

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>The Search Portlet will place a search box in your Portlet Column.

This search box will search the Titles, Descriptions, and Body text of

objects on your site for the text specified. You have the option of

enabling Live Search. Live Search is a feature which shows live results

if the browser supports JavaScript.<br><br></p>

<h3>Static Text</h3>

<p>The Static Text Portlet allows you to enter content just as you

would on a normal Page object. This is useful for adding hyperlink to

different sites or any information that will not change. An example of

this Portlet is the "Still Stumped?" Portlet on the right hand side of

this site. For more on Static Text Portlets and an example view the
