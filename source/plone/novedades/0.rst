Plone 0.9.9 - Bola - Released May 25, 2002
==========================================

    - Replaced all references to TextColor with FontColor, added
      headingFontColor property

    - New undo page

    - New search results page

    - All CSS and most HTML validate according to W3C's validators

    - fixed up MembershipTool which will add a homepage which will partcipate
      in workflow

    - added a FormulatorTool (portal_form_validation) which is a *thin* wrapper
      around Formulator and exposes
      minimal amounts of functionality.  I didnt know about CMFFormsTool when I
      did this (cmf.zope.org not doing its job)
      so I will have to take another look at whether or not we should go with
      this more advanced component.

    - in CSS we have: class="label required" now, and "field error" if a error
      has occurred.

    - added validation for all *_edit_forms, look in
      plone_scripts/validate_*

    - removed plone_images/img, all images are now in plone_images
        WARNING: you should always specify the full url to the image or caching
        will not occur. ${here/portal_url}/image.gif
        You want to cache as many images on the client side (or in caches in
        front of your ZOPE) as possible.

    - navigate* scripts were fixed (thanks to AndyD) which were causing some
      authentication errors

    - seperated form specific scripts into plone_form_scripts (this includes
      validation scripts)

    - file_view when you download no longers puts trailing 0's and uploaded file
      and image views

    - file and images will change id's to the uploaded file (strip extension).
      if you -specify- an id, like all other objects the file will be renamed to
      this id regardless of uploaded file
      there is no validation on file and images

    - fixed folder_edit (renaming was broke) also added validation - if you
      specify a id, the title is not mandatory.
      we dont want people to have autogenerated ID's in the folder_contents
      listing

    - plone_calendar added - thanks to AndyD
        calendar now works out of the box (after running installation script)

    - fixed ordinary view and 'up one level'.

    - ability to remove MyPortrait

    - put absolute paths in for stylehseets (in the @imports we do that in a
      script, CSSImports.py)

    - all stylesheets now send back RESPONSE headers that promote caching on
      clients

    - in Install/Upgrade we set a property, allowAnonymousViewAbout which
      toggles whether or not anonymous users
      should see a content's about box.  by default it is turned off.
      content_template was impacted

    - navigation works nicely if you are logged in. you can 'go up one level'
      to the root URL and then gets it folder_contents
      should promote people to put content in-place.

    - join_form is now validated using portal_form_validation, we need people
      to review this code!

    - Plone Folder is now the default Folder type inside a portal.

    - if there is no index_html defined it will display Directory Listing
          (like Apache)

    - folder_listing.pt uses Access Contents Information permission

    - if index_html it renders that

    - currently old folders are not converted to the Plone Folders in a
          website.  we need to migration script to do this.

    - CSS can now be manipulated by CSSValues.py, dont need to customize to the
      CSS themselves. This means you can keep your colors even if we change the
      CSS files.

    - individual objects can be toggled discussionable in their metadata edit
      forms (taken from CMF1.2 metadata form)

    - discussions attached to a object use structured-text

    - from folder_contents you can now publish multiple objects if you have
      permission

    - join_box doesnt show up if anonymous doenst have access to add portal
      member

    - Netscape 4.x graceful degrading added. It has its own CSS files.

    - review_box shows all content that matches any worklist where you qualify
      NOTE: this means DCWorkflow has now become -required- and you should use
      worklists to assign items to people.

    - if you are in multiple worklists, you will not get duplicate entries in
      review list in your UI ;)

    - took out unused getObject() calls in search.pt

    - Changed ALL pages to use main_template as their template, instead of the
      previous two portal_template and content_template.
      This means we are compatible with all existing CMF Products, although
      they can break our look a wee bit if they are coded
      badly, which a lot of Products unfortunately are.

    - Added new method to deal with CSS values - stylesheet_properties.props

    - standard_html_header/footer are now in place for backwards compatibility.
      thanks Evan Simpson!

    - Collector and Wiki have been minimally skinned (plone_3rdParty)

    - added default content to the root of Plone, index_html

    - moved most of the boxes into plone_ui_slots (trying to lighten
      portal_boxes), added FSDirectoryView for ui_slots

    - you can now create a Plone site by simply 'Add Plone Site' from inside
      the ZMI (thanks Lalo!)

    - suppressed empty comment history in content_status_history

    - Calendar slot works as Expected (only published events show up)

    - rejected content status no longer redirects to a search page

    - if you upload a binary into a Document object, form validation gripes
      [useability issue]

    - CMFTopics pretty much work, there is a bit more work to do.

    - personalize.py and other CMF1.3 issues have been resolved (setting a
      member properties API has changed in 1.2->1.3)

    - showEditableBorder has gone through quite a bit of changes.. still is
      wrong

    - Comments have been modified - they are still unuseable ;(

    - Lucas Marshall pointed out a javascript error in the calendar slot on
      MacOS and a fix 8)

    - News items can now use structured-text in the edit_form

    - my_worklist works correctly and sorts in ascending order for modified

    - you can now edit text of File objects who has text content_type

    - added StringIO string access

    - added 'change status' button that allows mass publishing of folder
      contents

    - refactored filesystem directory view skin structure

    - plone_scripts contains scrips and supporting form_scripts

    - plone_templates containers site wide templates and supporting ui_slots

    - plone_styles container default style and optional plone_themes

    - base href is now compatible with how other CMF Products work.  This
      means you can use other CMFProducts out of hte box (hopefully ;)

    - beginnings of workspace

    - moved back to 2 column layout (CMFPlone/Extensions/Upgrade.py
      migrate2ColumnLayout function)

    - no longer have to go to folder_factories to create a certain type,
      can do it from folder_contents

    - many more changes and cleanups

      Install script installs skins
      navigation boxes work (left hand side)

    - some security calls have been put in place

    - navigation is much nicer and lends itself to more real-world use of CMF as

      like listFolderContents)
      breadcrumbs overhauled

    - comments have been changed, still more to go before 1.0

      can be edited)

      folder

      logged in all \*_edit scripts return back to objects view

    - changing ID works in \*_edit_form

      following:

    - create a folder, .personal in your home folder

    - create a image in .personal called MyPortrait

    - publishing your /Members/\/.personal/MyPortrait image

    - folder_contents now sort (case insensitive) alphabetically by default,
      no more 'pagination' in batches of 10

    - added current server time in the top right corner ;)

    - content_status_history has been simplified -- still hardcoded
      transitions ;(
