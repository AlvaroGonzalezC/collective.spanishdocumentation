<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Before installing Plone on Linux, BSD or other Unix-like operating
systems, you should make sure that you have the following packages
installed:</p>

<div>

<ul><li>

<p>gcc, a C compiler</p>

</li><li>

<p>g++, &nbsp;software to extend gcc to compile C++ code</p>

</li><li>

<p>GNU make, a compilation tool</p>

</li><li>

<p>GNU tar, package for creating tar archives</p>

</li><li>

<p>bzip2 and gzip decompression packages</p>

</li></ul></div>

<p>The following packages are also recommended, although they aren't needed to build Plone</p>

<div>

<ul><li>

<p>libssl, a package that allows the use of TSL with your mail server.</p>

</li><li>

<p>readline, a GNU package that increases the ability of applications to edit terminal commands.</p>

</li></ul></div>

<h3>Getting the Plone Installer</h3>

<p>The installer for Linux/BSD/Unix, called the Unified Installer, can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="http://plone.org/products" target="_blank">this page</a>&nbsp;of the Plone website.</p>

<ol><li>Click on the <em>Download Plone</em> button and you will be taken to page that lists the various installers for Plone.&nbsp;</li><li>Click on the link for the Unified Installer to begin downloading Plone. &nbsp;</li><li>After
it has finished downloading, open up a terminal and change directories
to where the installer file you downloaded is located. &nbsp;</li><li>Extract
the installer by typing "tar xzf InstallerName ", where InstallerName
is the name of the Plone Installer you downloaded. &nbsp;</li><li>In your command prompt enter the directory of the folder you just extracted.</li></ol><h3>Configuring your Plone installation</h3>

<p>The first thing you must decide when installing Plone is decide
whether you would like a ZEO or a standalone installation. You should
probably use ZEO if you are going to be using Plone for any production.
However, if you are just testing out Plone or are going to use it for
development, the standalone option would be best. For a more in-depth
discussion read&nbsp;<a href="http://plone.org/documentation/manual/installing-plone/installing-on-linux-unix-bsd/to-zeo-or-not-to-zeo" target="_blank">this section</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To initiate the installation type "./install.sh method" where method
is either "standalone" or "zeo". If you would like to install Plone in
server mode type "<strong>sudo</strong>&nbsp;./install.sh method" or
run the installation script as root some other way. A complete list of
command-line options can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://plone.org/documentation/kb/installing-plone-with-the-unified-installer/command-line-options" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Last steps</h3>

<p>Near the end of the installation, the installer should have printed
out the default username and password for your Plone installation to
the terminal. &nbsp;If you have trouble finding them, they are also
listed inside of a text file called <em>adminPassword.txt</em> (which can be found in the <em>zinstance</em> folder of your Plone installation).</p>

<p>To start Plone:</p>

<ol><li>"cd" to your Plone install directory.</li><li>Enter your zinstance folder.</li><li>Execute "./bin/plonectl start". (The port Plone uses may be adjusted in buildout.cfg and then running "/bin/buildout").</li><li>Browse to your instance by visting <em>http://localhost:8080</em> in your web browser. If you specified another port, use it instead of <em>8080</em>.</li><li>Click
on "Create a new Plone site" and enter your login information to start
using Plone. Enter in the requested information and then submit the
form to finish the creation of your site. You can find your site at
http://localhost:8080/<em>SiteName</em>, where "SiteName" is the Id of your Plone site.</li></ol><p>To stop the Plone process run "./bin/plonectl stop". &nbsp;Have fun using Plone!</p>

<h2><span class="Apple-style-span">OS X</span></h2>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span">If you want to use Plone on a desktop
Mac, the OS X binary installer is a good choice. It uses the OS X
installer and provides a visual controller. However, since it provides
pre-compiled binaries, it's very hard to add new components that
require binary builds. If you need to do that, add XCode to your system
and use the Unified Installer.<br></span></p>

<h2>Windows (2000, 2003, XP, Vista, 7)</h2>

<h3>Getting Plone</h3>

<p>You can download Plone for Windows from&nbsp;<a href="http://plone.org/products" target="_blank">this page</a>.</p>

<ol><li>Click on the&nbsp;<em>Download Plone</em>&nbsp;button.</li><li>Click on the link for the Windows Installer and save it to a memorable location like your Desktop.</li><li>Double-click the installer file to initiate the installation process.</li></ol><h3>The Plone Installation Wizard</h3>

<ol><li>Enter the directory where you would like to install Plone to.
&nbsp;For most people, the default entry should be fine.(Click "Next"
after each step to continue)</li><li>Enter in your desired username and password for the administrator account.</li><li>Review the current configuration options.</li><li>During
the installation a progress bar will show how close the installer is to
completion. &nbsp;Mark the check boxes to show whether you would like
to add Plone as a service so that it will automatically run at
startup.(Note: This can be changed at any time by running
"bin\instance.exe remove" from your install directory) &nbsp;or if you
would like to run Plone after exiting the installer.</li></ol><h3>Starting up Plone</h3>

<p>If you decided not to make Plone a service you can start and stop
your Plone instances by going to your Plone directory in your command
line and executing:</p>

<pre>bin/instance.exe fg</pre>

<p>or by using the Plone Controller GUI. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Plone Controller can be found in your menu at Start → All
Programs → Plone → Plone Controller. &nbsp;It is used to edit Plone's
settings and to start or stop Plone. If you decide that you want to
make Plone a service execute:</p>

<pre>bin/instance.exe install</pre>

<p>Likewise, to unistall Plone execute:</p>

<pre>bin/instance.exe remove</pre>

<p>Once you have started an instance of Plone, you can view it by
visiting http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. If it won't load,
make sure that your firewall hasn't blocked the TCP port 8080.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Click on "Create a new Plone site" and enter your login information
to start using Plone. &nbsp;Enter in the requested information and then
submit the form to finish the creation of your site. &nbsp;You can find
your site at http://localhost:8080/<em>SiteName</em>, where "SiteName" is the Id of your Plone site. Have fun with Plone!</p></div>

                What is the Unified Installer?
            </h1>

            <div>
                
                    <div><p>The Unified Installer is a source

installation kit for installing Python, Zope, Plone and their

dependencies on Unix-like platforms. It has two major components:</p>

<ul><li>The source packages for Python, Zope,

Plone, a couple of system libraries and some Python libraries;</li><li>An installation script that uses the

packages to create a ready-to-run, relatively self-contained,

Python/Zope/Plone install that meets the Plone community's

best-practices standards.</li></ul><p>The
new Zope/Plone install will use its
own copy of Python, and the Python installed by the Unified Installer
will not replace your system's copy of Python. You may optionally use
your system (or some other) Python, and the Unified Installer will use
it without modifying it or your site libraries.</p>

<h3>Why the Unified Installer? Why Not System

Packages/Ports?</h3>

<p>On the Plone help lists and channel, the suggestion to "just use the

Unified Installer" often draws one of two reactions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>I prefer to manage the source install

myself, picking all the target directories;</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>There's nothing wrong with that, though

if you use the Unified Installer's target directories you may find it

easier to get help from the Plone community.</p>

<p>If you still choose to install by hand,

that's fine. You may still find it convenient to download the Unified

Installer in order to get all the packages together, and you may find

it useful to read the UI's install.sh script for ideas on building

particular components.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>I prefer to use my platform's

ports/packages mechanism.</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The history of platform packages for

Zope and Plone is a troubled one. Platform packages have been of

uneven quality and have used installation trees that make it

difficult for the community to offer help when problems occur. Also,

platform packages have historically been vulnerable to changes in the

system Python. Zope/Plone is very picky about the version of Python

used to run it, and an update of the system Python when some other

item is installed can easily break Zope/Plone. At this point, you may

be thinking that this just means that the packages have poorly

specified dependencies. The Unified Installer was created because

generation after generation of packages did not solve this problem.</p>

<h3>Major Unified Installer Options</h3>

<p>The Unified Installer for Plone has

three major options:</p>

<ul><li>Install as root or normal user;</li><li> Install as a ZEO Cluster, or a

stand-alone Zope;</li><li>Install the full kit, or just a

single running instance.</li></ul><p>Each of these options are described in

a separate section.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Prior versions of the Unified

Installer do not have these options</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Changes for Plone 4</h3>

<ul><li>The installer now includes a <em>develop.cfg</em> configuration
file, which you may use after the initial installation to configure a
common development environment. To use it, run buildout with the
command:<br><pre>bin/buildout -c develop.cfg</pre>

</li><li>The installer now requires that SSL development libraries be
preinstalled on your system (usually done with openSSL). If it can't
find them, it halts. If you wish, you may bypass this requirement,
which will result in an installation that can't use ESMTP for mail.<br></li></ul><h3>Changes for Plone 3.1</h3>

<ul><li>The Unified Installer now uses buildout to configure Plone 

instances, which makes it much easier for you to control add-ons and 

upgrade your Plone installation.</li><li>It's much easier to add 

additional Zope/Plone instances to an existing install base.</li><li>There

 are additional options for:</li>

<ul><li>Controlling the installation target directory;</li><li>Setting a

 user other than "admin" and/or setting a password of your choice;</li><li>Using

 an already installed Python 2.4 (possibly the system copy). virtualenv 

is used to isolate the new installation so that your system Python is 

not touched.</li></ul><li>If libjpeg or libz installation is required, it's done locally to 

the new install. Even in a root-mode install, your system libraries are 

not touched.</li></ul><h3>Changes for Plone 3</h3>

<p>If you've used the Unified Installer

for prior versions of Plone, you'll already know that the options

above are new. There are a few additional changes:</p>

<ul><li>The installation script tries to

determine whether or not you need new builds of the libz and libjpeg.

If you don't, it won't build them.</li><li>The UI now works more easily with

odd-duck platforms like Solaris, where common GNU build tools may be

in uncommon locations.</li><li>This version omits some optional

products (TextIndexNG#, ReportLab) bundled with prior versions.</li><li>This version includes the new Python

easy install kit, though it doesn't use it.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

                    <div><p>The install.sh script for the Unified

Installer may be run as root (typically via sudo) or as a normal

user. Key differences are:

</p><p><br><strong>The root (production) install:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Installs by default to

/usr/local/Plone;</li><li>Creates a "plone" user,

sets this user as owner of the data files, and configures Zope

to run as the effective user "plone".</li><li>Program and configuration files are owned by the root user, and should not be writable by the Zope process. <br></li></ul><p><strong>The normal (non-root) user install:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Installs by default to

$HOME/Plone;</li><li>Is meant to be run by and under the

effective user id of the installing user.</li></ul><h3>Why Choose root or normal?</h3>

<p>Installing as root (or with root

privileges via sudo) may be the best choice for a production installation

of Plone. Since this install runs under the user id of a user created

specifically for this purpose, it should have a more controllable

level of access to resources. It is a generally accepted "best

practice" to run persistent processes (like Zope) as unique

users with limited rights.</p>

<p class="callout">If you install via root, though, be careful not to
run "sudo bin/buildout" except in offline mode since this would
immediately run setup downloaded programs. Instead, obtain distribution
files from validated sources, put them in buildout-cache/download/dist
and run buildout in offline mode.</p>

<p>Installing as a normal user (perhaps

with your own user identity) may be a better choice for a test or

development instance. It makes it very easy to install and edit

custom products without worrying about user rights or identities.</p>

            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">The
Unified Installer will install Zope to either run in a Client/Server or
stand-alone configuration. Here are the merits of each.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>The Unified Installer offers two

different strategies for your Zope configuration:

</p><ul><li>A ZEO Client/Server configuration.

ZEO (Zope Enterprise Objects) allows you to have several Zope clients

processes (or separate servers) that share a common object database

server process.</li><li>A stand-alone Zope instance.<br></li></ul><p><strong>The stand-alone Zope instance</strong> is

simpler to understand, integrate and control, and is probably the

best choice for a simple or test environment.</p>

<p><strong>The ZEO Client/Server

configuration</strong>, though, has several advantages for production or

development use:</p>

<ul><li>Better load balancing options. Even

without a load-balancing proxy, running independent client and server

processes can spread the load better on modern multi-core servers.

With a load-balancing proxy, even better results are possible.</li><li>The ability to run scripts against a

live site. You may use "zopectl run" to run scripts on one

of the clients while others serve the site to the Internet.</li><li>Better debugging. You may run one

client in debug mode while the rest run in production mode. You may

then have improved diagnostics for the debug instance. You'll also be

able to use introspection tools like Clouseau and "zopectl

debug" against a live site.</li><li>You may reserve a client for

administrative access (it'll have its own port). Then, if you're

slashdotted before you're ready, you'll be able to make changes via

the administrative client even when your public client slows down.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

            <div>
                
                    <div><h3>Preparations</h3>

<p>Crank up your platform's package manager and make

sure you've got the following installed:</p>

<ul><li>gcc, the GNU Compiler Collection.</li><li>g++, the C++ extensions for gcc.</li><li>GNU make, the fundamental

build-control tool.</li><li>GNU tar. This is the version of tar

on all Linux, BSD and OS X platforms, but not Solaris.</li><li>bzip2 and gzip

decompression packages. gzip is nearly standard; some platforms will require that bzip2 be installed.<br></li></ul><blockquote>

<p>Ideally, you should also have the <em>libssl </em>and <em>readline </em>libraries
and development headers loaded (usually, the libssl-dev and
readline-dev packages). These are not required, but add desirable
functionality. <em>libssl </em>is required to use TLS with your mail
server, which may be vital if it's not local. See the Unified Installer
README.txt for details.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now, choose a convenient working

directory and unpack the .tar.gz archive (tarball) of the Unified

Installer:</p>

<pre>tar zxf Plone-VERSION-UnifiedInstaller.tar.gz</pre>

<p>Then change into the newly created

directory:</p>

<pre>cd Plone-VERSION-UnifiedInstaller</pre>

<p>("VERSION-" will vary with

release.)</p>

<h3>Running install.sh</h3>

<p>If you've chosen to install with root

privileges, either su to root or precede these commands with sudo.</p>

<p><strong>ZEO Installation:</strong></p>

<pre>./install.sh zeo</pre>

<p><strong><br>Stand-Alone Zope Installation:</strong></p>

<pre>./install.sh standalone</pre>

<p>Then, sit back and watch the progress messages.</p>

<p><strong>If the progress messages don't start,</strong>

it will typically mean that a vital installation tool is missing. Use

your package manager to install the tool, and try again.</p>

<p><strong>If the installation succeeds,</strong> you'll

see a set of instructions for starting your new Zope/Plone install.

Make note of the password for the "admin" user. These

instructions will also be available in README.txt file, and the pass word in "adminPassword.txt", in your new install.</p>

<p><strong>If the installation should fail,</strong> don't

panic. Make note of any error messages or diagnostics and, if you

can't remedy the problem yourself, ask for help in the plone-setup

mailing list or the #plone IRC channel. We'll need precise

information about your platform and all possible diagnostic

information to help. Also, make sure to check the <em>Platform Notes</em>

section of the README.txt file included with the installer to see if there might be a work-around or

special requirement note for your platform.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The install script creates a detailed log file, install.log, that may help diagnose an installation failure.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Checking your installation</h3>

<p>If your installation succeeded, try starting it by following the
instructions displayed at the end of the install process (or in the
README.txt file in the install directory). Startup problems are
uncommon, but do occasionally happen. The most common cause is that
some other process has already claimed the 8080 port (or one or more of
the 8100, 8080 and 8081 ports if you're using ZEO). You may wish to
stop or kill the competing process if it's an old Zope/Plone
installation. If not, you may reassign the ports used by your Plone
installation by editing the buildout.cfg file and running bin/buildout
to reassign ports.</p>

<p>If the start is successful, test your installation by opening a web
browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080. (If you're testing on
another machine, substitute your server host name for "localhost".)</p>

<p>You should see a Zope welcome message. A test Plone site should be
available at http://localhost:8080/Plone, and the Zope Management
Interface at http://localhost:8080/manage.</p>

<p>If Zope appears to be running, but you cannot connect, check to see if a firewall may be in place and blocking the connection.</p></div>

                2.5.
                Creating New Instances
            </h1>

            <p class="documentDescription">The Unified Installer may be used to create additional Zope/Plone instances.</p>
    
            <div>
                
                    <div><p>Once you have used the Unified

Installer to build a complete Plone install, you may wish to

create additional working instances to run other sites (or sets of

sites). The Unified Installer makes it possible to set up new

instances that will use the Python and Zope code base of your main

install.</p>

<p>To install a new instance, first decide
whether it will be a root or normal-user install. You may use the
code base of a root-level install for a new root-level instance, or a
non-root install for a new non-root instance. Also, the new instance
may be a ZEO or stand-alone
install, independent of the choice made for the main installation.</p>

<h3>The Commands<br></h3>

<p>Change into the directory containing

the install.sh file of your unpacked Universal Installer.</p>

<p>

Precede the following commands by

"sudo" or by using "su -" to switch to root</p>

<p><strong>For a ZEO cluster instance:</strong></p>

<pre>./install.sh zeo --instance=new_instance_name</pre>

<p><strong>For a stand-alone Zope instance:</strong></p>

<pre>./install.sh standalone --instance=new_instance_name
</pre>

<p><span class="visualHighlight">new_instance_name</span> should be a
simple directory name -- not a full pathname. The new directory will be
created as a new subdirectory of your full installation and will share
its Python and buildout cache.</p>

<h3>Setting New Ports</h3>

<p>Your new instance isn't ready to run yet, because it's set to use
the default ports and will conflict with the previous installation.
Fortunately, that's easy to fix.</p>

<p>Change into the directory containing your new instance and open buildout.cfg with your favorite text editor.</p>

<p>If this is a standalone instance, you'll need to set a new port in just one spot:</p>

<pre>http-address = 8080</pre>

<p>There's a little more work for a ZEO instance. You'll need to change
two http-address entries (one for each client) and the port for the ZEO
server, which is set in the line:</p>

<pre>zeo-address = 127.0.0.1:8100</pre>

<p>Change only the port number (8100); leave the IP address alone.</p>

<h3>Build It</h3>

<p>Save your changes and run buildout to update all the parts of the installation:</p>

<pre>bin/buildout
</pre>

<p>If this is a root install, preface the command with "sudo" or use su to change to root.</p>

<p>You're now ready to run your new instance.</p></div>

</dd><dt>--user=user-name</dt>

<dd>In a root install, sets the effective user for running the instance. Default is 'plone'. Ignored for non-root installs.</dd>

will be used to create an isolated Python environment for the
installation. Your system's site library will not be touched. Python
2.4 is required for Plone 3.x, Python 2.6 for Plone 4.<br>
Your Python must meet the needs of Plone, and the installer will test
it for zlib, libssl and xml support before building for it.</dd>



<dt>--password=InstancePassword</dt>

<dd>If not specified, a random password will be generated.</dd><dt>--without-ssl</dt><dd>SSL
(usually OpenSSL) development libraries are needed to build a Python
that will support SSL and TLS. Without it, Plone will be unable to use
TLS in SMTP. The Unified Installer will ordinarily stop if it can't
find the SSL headers and libraries. Use this option to tell the
installer that you know what you're doing, and wish to proceed without
SSL.</dd><dt>--without-lxml </dt><dd>lxml, a Python wrapper for libxml2
and libxslt, is not required for Plone 4.1. But it is needed by some
popular addons like plone.app.theming. Unless you specify this flag,
the installer will try to build lxml with static libxml2 and libxslt
libraries. This may not work on all platforms. <br></dd></dl><h3></h3>

<dl><dt>--nobuildout</dt><dd>Skip running bin/buildout. You should know what you're doing. The 

main use for this option is if you want to use the Unified Installer to 

put all the pieces together, then plug in your own buildout.cfg.</dd></dl><p>The
Unified Installer will try and figure out whether or not you have the
libz, libjpeg and readline libraries on your system. If you do, great;
if not, the installer will try to build them in the lib/ subdirectory

what you want. If not, use the following command-line options to tune
the behavior.</p>

<div class="commentBody">The

main issues on Solaris are due to the fact that the installer script

(install.sh) cannot always get the correct paths for the correct

versions of software on Solaris. It also has problems finding the

correct libraries in the Solaris environment. To add to this install.sh

uses the basic Bourne shell (#!/bin/sh), which means that some of the

commands which are part of the Linux Bourne shell and which are not

present in the Solaris Bourne shell just do not work. Notably the -e

(exists) switch is not present in the Solaris Bourne shell:</div>

<pre>if [ -e $INSTALL_LOG ]       # Does not work in Solaris.</pre>

<div class="commentBody"><br>In order to solve this do the following:<br><br>1. The locations of all dependencies need to be located on Solaris:<br>&nbsp;(a) gcc - /usr/local/bin/gcc (gcc-3.4.6 installed from www.sunfreeware.com - default on solaris 10 is /opt/sfw/bin/gcc)<br>&nbsp;(b) g++ - /usr/local/bin/g++ (Installed with gcc-3.4.6 - default on solaris 10 = /opt/sfw/bin/g++)<br>&nbsp;(c) gmake - /opt/sfw/bin/gmake<br>&nbsp;(d) gtar - /usr/sfw/bin/gtar<br>&nbsp;(e) gzip - /usr/bin/gzip<br>&nbsp;(f) bzip2 - /usr/bin/bzip2<br><br>In addition install.sh uses the "whoami" shell command, which on Solaris is in:<br><br>&nbsp;(g) whoami - /usr/ucb/whoami<br><br>2. Ensure the above PATHs are all in the system path:</div>

<pre>PATH=$PATH:/opt/sfw/bin:/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/ucb:/usr/ccs/bin
export PATH
</pre>

<div class="commentBody"><br>(If /usr/ccs/bin is not added, the Python compile will fail with "gmake: ar: Command not found".)<br><br>3.

As the -e switch is not present in the Solaris Bourne shell, install.sh

and all other scripts must be changed to bash: #!/usr/bin/bash<br><br>4.

install.sh uses the "which" shell command to locate the software it

needs for the build. To ensure the correct versions of the software

were used (rather than any Solaris defaults), install.sh was modified

to explicitly set the location of each piece of software:</div>

<pre>GCC=/usr/local/bin/gcc
GPP=/usr/local/bin/g++
GNU_MAKE=/opt/sfw/bin/gmake
GNU_TAR=/usr/sfw/bin/gtar
GUNZIP=/usr/bin/gunzip
BUNZIP2=/usr/bin/bunzip2</pre>

<div class="commentBody"><br>5. During the Python build, both the "libssl" and "readline" libraries are needed. Add them to the system library path:</div>

<pre>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/ssl/lib:/opt/sfw/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre>

<h3>Using the Controller</h3>

<p>You can access the Plone Windows Controller from the Start button
â Programs â Plone. You can use the controller to&nbsp;start/stop
the Plone server (Zope) and check its status.</p>

<h3>Using the command line</h3>

<p>After the installer is finished, open a Command Prompt window (usually in Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories).</p>

<p>Move into your Plone installation directory, which you wrote down earlier. Example: cd "\Program Files\Plone".</p>

<p>To start your Plone instance for the first time, issue this command: "bin\instance.exe fg".</p>

<p>This will start Plone in debug mode. It will display the port number
that Plone is running on, which is 8080 by default. You will know your
Plone instance has finished starting and is ready when you see the
message "INFO Zope Ready to handle requests" in the terminal.</p>

<p>To stop Plone, just use a CTRL-C in you Command Prompt window.</p>

<h2><span class="typeface-js-vector-container"><span class="typeface-js-selected-text">Starting&nbsp;</span><span class="typeface-js-selected-text">Plone&nbsp;</span><span class="typeface-js-selected-text">as&nbsp;</span><span class="typeface-js-selected-text">a&nbsp;</span><span class="typeface-js-selected-text">service</span></span><br></h2>

<p>If you'd like Plone to start as a service when you start your
computer you'll need to CD into your Plone install directory, then
issue the following command in your Command Prompt window:
"bin\instance install". This will install a new service that will show
up in your Services Management Console. It will be listed as: "Zope
instance at C:\Program Files\Plone\parts\instance.exe" if you installed
to "C:\Program Files\Plone".</p>

<p>After the service is installed you can start Plone immediately by
issuing the following command in your Command Prompt window:
"bin\instance.exe start", or use the Plone Controller (see above).</p>

<p>If you'd like to remove the service later, just CD into your Plone
install directory, then issue this command in your Command Prompt
window: "bin\instance.exe remove".</p>

<h2><span class="typeface-js-vector-container"><span class="typeface-js-selected-text">Accessing&nbsp;</span><span class="typeface-js-selected-text">Plone</span></span></h2>

<p>You may need to tell your firewall to open TCP Port 8080 before you can access Plone's web interface.</p>

<p>Open a browser window and browse to http://localhost:8080/. Click on
the button with the text "Create a new Plone site" on it. You'll be
asked for the username and password that you wrote down earlier.</p>

<p>Give your site an Id, like "Plone", and a Title, like "My Plone
Site". You can also select the site language and some additional
products for installing. Then click on the "Add Plone Site" button near
the bottom of the page. It will take a few seconds to create your Plone
site<br><br>After your site is created you can access it with this URL: <em>http://localhost:8080/Plone</em>, where "Plone" is the Id you gave to your site.</p>
